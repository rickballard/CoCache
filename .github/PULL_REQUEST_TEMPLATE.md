## Summary
<!-- What and why -->

## Scope
- [ ] Doc only
- [ ] Policy/principles
- [ ] CC megascroll component
- [ ] Code/automation

## Cool-down & Safety
- [ ] I am not in cool-down, or this PR has a second review.
- [ ] If late-hours (01:00â€“05:00 local), I paused for a sanity pass.

## Being Noname (name integrity)
- [ ] If this touches BN, the exact string **"Being Noname"** is preserved.

## Canonicity
- [ ] If changing `canon_level: pillar` or `chartered`, governance rules were followed.
