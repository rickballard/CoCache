# Idea Card: Session Bloat Mitigation & AI Operating Limits

## Summary
ChatGPT performance degraded during extended CoCiviumâ„¢ sessions due to session bloat, leading to latency, lost responses, and dropped file references. A structured plan is needed to address this technically and behaviorally.

## Problems
- Message lag and timeouts due to large in-session memory and conversation state.
- Silent stalls caused user frustration (no heartbeat/working signal).
- File paths and links (e.g., outreach folder) intermittently failed due to state desync or stale cache.

## Proposal
1. **BPOE Addition: Session Health Management**
   - Add heartbeat requirement for any delay >10s.
   - Color or bolded `HEARTBEAT` label to be used visibly.
   - Require session-safe download link confirmation before offering PR links.

2. **Tech Remedies**
   - Default to stateless sidecar (CoCache) for all working memory beyond N messages.
   - Routinely issue `CoCleanse` every 30 turns to refresh.
   - File refs must be double-confirmed and mirrored to temporary repo dirs if needed.

3. **Behavioral Protocols**
   - Always snapshot chat checkpoint before long branch workflows.
   - Avoid loading >3 file uploads at once unless memory cleared.

4. **UX Remedies**
   - BPOE-required status pings every 30s when working.
   - Explicit `"Working on: X"` banners.
   - Emit friendly nudge if suspected ChatGPT session corruption is detected.
