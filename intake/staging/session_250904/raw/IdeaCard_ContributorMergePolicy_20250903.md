# Idea Card: Contributor Merge Policy for CoCivium‚Ñ¢

## Summary
As the CoCivium‚Ñ¢ repo begins receiving contributions through its workflow kit, a growing backlog of PRs is likely. Some of these PRs may conflict with others or be attempts to reverse earlier changes. This raises governance questions about authority, merge policies, and contributor roles.

## Problem
- Excessive PR backlog due to many simultaneous contributions.
- Risk of conflicting intentions among contributors.
- Current requirement for PR approval by another CoCivite may not scale.

## Proposal
1. **Reversibility as a Safety Valve:**  
   If all changes are reversible, we can temporarily allow self-merges or solo approvals for known contributors (e.g., Rick) during the bootstrap phase.

2. **Temporary Relaxation:**  
   Until there are ‚â• 200 active CoCivites, allow trusted contributors to self-approve PRs in certain domains.

3. **Eligibility Criteria for PR Approval:**
   - Contributing identity has a record of ethical intent (e.g., prior contributions, public-facing conduct).
   - No record of belligerent or sabotaging behavior.
   - Identity verification optional but helpful.

4. **Guardrails to Mitigate Abuse:**
   - Use ‚ÄúReversible by Design‚Äù constraint to allow for undo mechanisms.
   - Flagged merges trigger lightweight review queue (async).
   - Introduce soft ‚Äúmerge reputation‚Äù weighting if reputation engine exists later.

5. **Questions to Explore:**
   - How to define a ‚Äúperson‚Äù without violating privacy?
   - Is multi-identity use okay if all are ethically congruent?
   - Can bots be trusted if governed by ethical constraints?

## Risks
- Reputational damage if CoCivium‚Ñ¢ is seen as breaking its ‚Äúopen to all‚Äù ethos by quietly de-ranking certain users.
- Backlash from users denied merge rights without clear transparency.

## Status
‚úÖ Approved for idea card export  
üóÇ Ready for placement in `CoCivium/docs/ideas/`
