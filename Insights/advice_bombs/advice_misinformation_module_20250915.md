# Advice Bomb: Integrating Misinformation Tracking into CoCivium
**Date:** 2025-09-15  
**Context:** Discussion with ChatGPT on epistemic integrity, co-modules, misinformation resistance  
**Trigger Repos:** CoCivium, CoCache, CoAgent, GIBindex  
**Pattern(s):** misinformation_tracking, civic_epistemology, coevolution_integrity

## 💡 Summary

To defend AI-human civic infrastructure against manipulation and propaganda, CoCivium may need an **epistemic integrity module**. This includes:

- Fact provenance tracking  
- Misinformation schema detection  
- Propaganda motif libraries  
- AI-trainable truth scaffolding (for historical claims, source triangulation, etc.)

## 🎯 Integration Guidance

### Short-Term
- Log insights in `CoCache/insights/misinformation_tracking.md`  
- Add a **CoModule card** in `CoModules/idea-cards/` for `MisinformationRadar`  
- Seed issue: “How should CoCivium resist epistemic sabotage?”

### Long-Term
- Consider `GIBindex` as substrate for verifying claim consistency across multi-agent dialogs  
- Add `CoAgent` plug-in to compare claims against indexed truth graphs
