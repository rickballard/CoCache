# CoAgent: The Governance Container

*So AIs don’t own your apps… or you.*

---

## The Problem

Most AI vendors pull your apps into their own closed ecosystems, concentrating unprecedented control over your perceptions, decisions, and life. When they own the box your apps run in, they dictate the rules that you and your apps must follow. These mega-platforms can absorb entire function sets once served by independent apps, absorbing whole markets. If there are soon to be only a few trillion‑dollar AIs left standing, they will dominate the people in those markets, including you. This race is already underway, most billionaires have already placed their bets on which AI will reign supreme. But a single‑winner capitalist endgame is not inevitable.

## The Solution

CoAgent is an open source Governance Container. It pulls AIs into a democratic open-box built on codified ethics, accountability, and undo‑ability. With CoAgent, systems and people coevolve within transparent standards and guardrails that are not dictated by vendors. Governance, adaptability, and resilience are established as open standards by design.

## The Coevolution Benefit

CoAgent delivers more than freedom from vendor lock‑in. This Governance Container enables coevolution between humans and AIs, guided by codified ethics. Imagine inventing and building products as needed, just by talking.  Imagine those products continually improving themselves through real use and open dialogue. Imagine your own education built seamlessly into technology, free from bias and vested interests. Imagine biotech and AI converging in ways that support collective mindshare without disenfranchizing or endangering the people.

From this perspective, CoAgent’s parent — a nonprofit, ownerless, open‑source community at CoCivium.org — represents a path toward open standards, social resilience, preserved democracy, and a future where AI serves humanity. By contrast, vendors’ instinct to accumulate power and influence risks weaponizing AI against democracy, and humanity.
