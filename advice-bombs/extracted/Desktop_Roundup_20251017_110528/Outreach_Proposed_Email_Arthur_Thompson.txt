Proposed outreach phase of CoCivim Email to Arthur Thompson, DNC CTO

Subject: Strategic Civic Tech for the Infrastructure You’re Already Building

Hi Arthur,

I’m Rick Ballard, founder of GroupBuild, a civic-tech platform built to strengthen ethical, reputation-aware participation—especially when central platforms are compromised or weaponized. Our approach blends meritocratic voting, anonymized identity layers, and AI-enhanced moderation into tools that help communities self-organize under pressure.

You’ve spoken publicly about the DNC’s dual mandate: securing digital infrastructure while exploring generative AI responsibly. GroupBuild was built specifically for that intersection—and I believe it could help advance the standards you're already pushing for:

Our AI moderation system (BeAxa) is designed to curb misinformation and elevate trusted contributors without platform bias.
Our AnonID framework protects identity while preserving civic accountability—crucial for high-risk organizing.
Our architecture naturally “leans into truth,” which tends to benefit Democrats more than Republicans in today’s info-warfare climate.
Your job is high-risk and high-visibility: You’re expected to futureproof Democratic infrastructure while avoiding missteps with experimental tech. GroupBuild isn’t asking you to take a risk—it’s designed to give you a low-friction, high-integrity option you can pilot discreetly, with full control. If nothing else, it may validate or pressure-test some of the assumptions behind existing DNC tooling.

What I’m Proposing
A 15-minute walkthrough tailored to your current stack and stressors.
A sandbox demo for internal vetting.
A whitepaper summary on where our ethics architecture overlaps with DNC priorities.
If this resonates, I’d be glad to share credentials and set up a time.

Thanks for pushing boundaries without losing the plot. GroupBuild was built to help with exactly that.​
