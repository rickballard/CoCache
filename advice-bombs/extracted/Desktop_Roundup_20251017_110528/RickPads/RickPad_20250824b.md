# RickPad â€” Consolidated Idea Cards & Ops Notes
Purpose: readable backlog for later inclusion in CoCivium Discussions (not yet an action list, need Discussions to turn them into actionables and then ChatGPT to lead execution of them, prioritized by value/need within CoCivium's vision), or otherwise for inclusion if valuable, into existing (or new) product-specific repo(s) as action items._

## How to use
- Keep a **single** RickPad (this file). When a card is ready for Discussions, mark `status=READY` and weâ€™ll prep the port text in your voice.
- We iterate here until a card is **APPROVED FOR DISCUSSION**; then we export to GitHub Discussions and remove it from RickPad.
- Each Idea Card uses: **Lead Â· Context Â· Proposal Â· Risks Â· Dependencies Â· Ask**.

Idea Card – put link on main root readme to a document that explains “Why CoCivium any different?”.  The document should explain and/or link to individucal docs that each go into detail about (most if not all) of our key: vision/mission directives, philosophies, principles, policies and initiatives, with a brief explanation of why each of those differs (if it does) from current norms and practices, all framed in an explanation of co-evolution via recursive, iterative, congruent coevolution of best practices to push out auto-implement proposals to legacy regulators and civic administrators.  This document thus forms a key companion to the CC, and it should thus perhaps look like an addon to the CC, not sure what you call such things as a category, maybe appendment or some such, but anyway, maybe the file should be called something like, or better than, “Insights_NewWay_datestampversionstuff.md”?  Not sure how you are structuring standardization of file names these days, but including the words “New” and “Way” seem to help explain what the file would be about, at least to me, that is.  
___________

Idea Card -- the logo for a CoPingPong related CoModule or product or kit, could be ping-pong related and cliparty, to show how simple the product is to use.  Maybe the tag line for such a product would be: "If you can play pingpong, you can be a digital entrepreneur.", or something better?

---------

Idea Card -- following import of my desktop projects to repos of their own, the repo structure for all repos in my Github account may need to be revised, following an all repos structure strategy that we preagree upon.  I would likely want the repos to be some private and some public, but all easy to view by a GitHub non-expert, and all automatically syncing with eachother to stay up to date, especially where they share resources or mirror them between repos.  One of the repos could be specifically for all the sample Constitutions we may need to download, or other best practice civic flagstone docs, from all around the world.  I do not know what Githubs storage limitations are for an unpaid account, but I suspect they make their money from heavy users/storage, so I will need to try to minimize the financial impacts on any repo hugification initiative.  

----


Idea Card -- CoCivium_Community_Objectives_versiondate.md should likely exist in some form, listing and prioritizing into categories, all the objectives of the CoCivium community, and tied to the vision statement document using adequate referencing/linkages.  


----------

Some files, especially those that may prove contentious, and even including the CC, may be improved by adding an empty freeform comment entry section, perhaps branded as Coevolution Ideation - please insert your upgrade ideas here, no good idea gets left behind, they all coevolve."  That way, any contributor that just wants to edit an existing file, may do so in a delineated manner that will not mess up the repo, and which will allow CoCivium to extract the idea from the file, leaving the comment field empty again, but with perhaps a note thanking the last commenter for their idea which, after a wait period, has been absorbed into the repo's coevolutionary workflows, but which remains editable or redactable, merely by adding more comment(s) against the absorbed idea/comment's CoChat number (a CoChat, or some such name, could be the name we give to Idea Cards (IC's?) in development, within the CoCivium environment).  Basically, we are setting up simplified civic architecture workflows for regular people who do not want to look at code, or expertise tutorials, so naming workflows with named assets may be in order, especially where such workflows do not already exist in digital society.  The human committee meetings that may follow these workflows, obviously do exist, so we would reuse standard naming for any of those kind of activities/assets that need to be referenced in CoCivium workflows, right?

## Idea Cards

-------------------------------

Idea Card - productize PB/Workflow/Scripts environment setup, perhaps call it "Vibench" and give it away via GitHub with donation requests should it prove profitable for the user, reask for donation(s) after key stage(s) of usage behavior.  Turn regular people into product producing coders who produce and ship, without having to read any code.  The use of a CLI cut/paste agent may be critical to this, so it may need to be created first.  If so, see suggestions in CoCivium_Capstone_Brief_Agent_MVP_2025-08-22, which is on my desktop and should perhaps be repackaged for inclusion in this IdeaPad.  

---------------------------------
## Idea Card â€” AIâ€‘Club (Prelaunch) Adversarial Seeding

**Purpose.** Run multiâ€‘model, dissentâ€‘driven seeding of GitHub Discussions to harden CoCivium policy/docs before launch. Use a *switchboard* to orchestrate 3â€“4 models per topic. Post under one account with explicit provenance so it never looks like sockpuppeting.

---

## Oneâ€‘liner

Create a **prelaunch/ai-club** track that spins up *evidenceâ€‘anchored*, *principled*, and *persona* critiques for priority backlog items, each thread labeled and fully attributed to its model+persona, then merge only the best syntheses into main after a rationality sweep.

---

## Why (problem)

* We need rigorous counters before firstâ€‘impression traffic hits the repo.
* Avoid singleâ€‘vendor bias.  Compare families of models.
* Build a public trail of how positions evolved, without drowning humans in noise.

---

## Scope (MVP)

* **Targets:** top 5â€“10 policies/docs (README, Governance, Decision Log method, Identity/Privacy, Public Records).
* **Models:** 3â€“4 distinct families via a router (e.g., Perplexity, Claude, Llamaâ€‘hosted, Gemini).
* **Outputs:** GitHub Discussions threads with TL;DR + citations + persona memos.  Additive docs only; no code.

---

## Naming & Labels

* **Program name:** **AIâ€‘Club (Prelaunch)**.
* **Branch:** `prelaunch/ai-club` (docs/ only; additive).
* **Discussions category:** *AIâ€‘Club Seeds*.
* **Labels:** `ai-seeded`, `prelaunch`, `persona:<id>`, `model:<id>`, `needs-citation` (if applicable), `rfc`, `decision-proposal`.

---

## Posting Rules (hard guardrails)

1. **Provenance required.** Every post begins with a header block and ends with a provenance footer (see templates).  No anonymous AI.
2. **Citations for facts.** Mark uncited sentences as *contestable*.
3. **Quota.** â‰¤ 1 thread per priority item; â‰¤ 4 model takes/thread; â‰¤ 1 persona per model.
4. **Human synthesis required.** A maintainer adds the first comment: TL;DR + â€œWhat would change our mind?â€?.
5. **No simulated stakeholders we can invite.** If humans exist, invite them.
6. **Close the loop.** Convert stabilized threads to RFCs and log a Decision Record.

---

## Workflow (3â€‘pass pattern)

1. **Evidence pass** â€” sourcesâ€‘first critique (e.g., Perplexity).  Deliver: counterâ€‘claims + links.
2. **Principled pass** â€” values/ethics tradeâ€‘offs (e.g., Claude).  Deliver: liberty/fairness/stability analysis.
3. **Persona pass** â€” one memo each from two ideological frames (e.g., Llama openâ€‘weights).  Deliver: structured argument + fallacy check.
4. **Optional ingest** â€” summarization or docâ€‘linking (e.g., Gemini) feeding 1â€“3.

Artifacts for each pass are saved under `docs/ai-club/artifacts/<topic>/<YYYY-MM-DD>/`.

---

## Discussion Template (header)

```
[AIâ€‘Club Seed] Topic: <short name>
Scope: <doc/PR/policy link>
Models: <list>
Frames: <liberty | fairness | stability | other>
Claims Table: <key claims vs counters>
TL;DR: <3â€“6 bullets>
```

## Provenance Footer (required)

```
â€” AIâ€‘seeded post â€”
Model: <name@version>  |  Persona: <id>  |  Router: <id>
Date: <ISO8601>  |  Run: temp=<x> top_p=<y>  |  Seed: <n>
Promptâ€‘Hash: <sha256>  |  Artifacts: docs/ai-club/artifacts/<topic>/<date>/
Notes: Uncited statements are contestable by policy.
```

---

## Branch & Merge Strategy

* Work happens on **`prelaunch/ai-club`**.  Only new docs/threads/indices; no edits to existing canonical files.
* Periodic **Rationality Sweep** PR to `main` that merges:

  * Synthesized â€œPositions Ledgerâ€? updates.
  * Matured RFCs.
  * Links from Discussions to Decisions.
* Conflicts handled by **Positions Ledger** (source of truth): `docs/positions/ledger.md` with fields: Claim â†’ Strongest Counter â†’ Current Stance â†’ Rationale â†’ Last Updated.

---

## Moderation SOP (checklist)

* [ ] Verify header + footer present.
* [ ] Verify labels applied (`ai-seeded`, `model:*`, `persona:*`).
* [ ] Quick source check; tag `needs-citation` where weak.
* [ ] Add human TL;DR + changeâ€‘myâ€‘mind test.
* [ ] If thread drifts, freeze until citations improve.
* [ ] Decision reached?  Link to Decision Record and close.

---

## Tooling (router/switchboard)

* Use a modelâ€‘router so one script can call multiple providers.
* Keep perâ€‘provider keys in local env; never commit.
* Emit a small JSON manifest per run: prompt, system prompt, parameters, model id, persona id, promptâ€‘hash.

---

## Metrics (success & kill criteria)

**Success:**

* â‰¥ 60% of seeded threads upgraded by humans (edits/citations).
* â‰¥ 50% converted to RFCs within 14 days.
* Mean time to decision â‰¤ 21 days on targeted topics.

**Kill/Adjust:**

* > 30% threads stale (>14 days) without steward.
* Complaints about legitimacy or confusion in firstâ€‘time contributors.
* Maintainer time > 4h/week on moderation.

---

## Risks & Mitigations

* **Astroturf optics** â†’ Bold provenance + single Discussion category (AIâ€‘Club Seeds).
* **Noise creep** â†’ Strict quotas; human synopsis requirement.
* **Bias import** â†’ Crossâ€‘family model mix; favor evidence pass.
* **Policy drift** â†’ Positions Ledger and timeâ€‘boxed RFCs.

---

## Timeline (suggested)

* **Week 0:** Create labels, category, ledger, SOP, router script stub; pick 5 topics.
* **Week 1:** Seed 2 topics endâ€‘toâ€‘end; review moderation load.
* **Week 2:** Seed 3 more; open first Rationality Sweep PR.

---

## Owners / Roles

* **Program Steward:** Rick (until delegated).
* **Moderators:** TBD (2â€“3 people; timeâ€‘boxed).
* **Synthesis Editor:** TBD (finalizes Positions Ledger & sweep PRs).

---

## Open Questions

* Should we stand up a **GitHub App** for posting, or keep singleâ€‘account provenance with headers?
* Do we want community *redâ€‘team bounties* for tightening citations?
* Whatâ€™s the right ceiling on concurrent threads (3? 5?) to avoid overload?

------------------------------------
## Idea Card
Make www.CoCivium.org, a long read website that pulls in chunks from the repo every time it builds a document, and uses cached chunks if those chunks seem to be incumbered or messed up.  We could perhaps use zero-build Docsify pages set in small chunks.

--------------------------------------
## Idea Card â€” My github repos all seem to be owned by RickBallard, because the show up with this address: https://github.com/rickballard yet they likely should look less owned by a single person and more by an open source community, or at least they should look like they are held in trust by me, right?  So, can or should we try to change that address, perhaps the CoCivium repo address should not be https://github.com/rickballard/CoCivium but should instead be https://github.com/opename/CoCivium or https://github.com/trustholding/CoCivium or some such?  And if we do change this address somehow, should I then create another github account using my rballard@inseed.com for current/future projects that should remain independent of CoCivium, yet also public so you can help me manage any overlaps or reuse CoCivium BPOE/Workflow ideas, etc?

----------------------------------------
## Idea Card â€” CoCivium Civic Imagination Awards
Purpose: Incentivize and spotlight works (articles, videos, episodes, podcasts, OSS explainers) that model or interrogate CoCivium principles: consent before coercion, transparency with accountability, federated self-governance, restorative over punitive justice, data dignity, and open standards. The award legitimizes cultural artifacts that help people see and stress-test a consentful digital society.

Working Name: Civic Imagination Awards.

Why Now (blunt)
A. Culture moves opinion faster than whitepapers. Those shaping narratives today will shape policy and product defaults tomorrow.
B. If we donâ€™t name and reward â€œgood patterns,â€? the engagement economy will continue to reward outrage and centralizing power.
C. Awards are cheap leverage. Done right, they produce outsized signal and partnerships.

Scope & Categories (pilot set)
A. Long-Form Essay / Book Chapter.
B. Investigative Reporting on Digital Power.
C. Video Episode / Film Segment (e.g., satire like South Park when it illuminates consent dynamics).
D. Explanatory Piece on OSS/Open Standards for Civic Use.
E. â€œReality Checkâ€? Award for works that critique us constructively.

Eligibility (clear rules)
A. Published in the last 24 months. Publicly viewable.
B. English or subtitled/captioned English.
C. Discloses funding and conflicts.
D. Not primarily an ad or sponsored content disguised as editorial.

Non-Eligibility / Red Flags
A. Hidden funding, astroturfing, or undisclosed affiliate schemes.
B. Factual fraud or pattern of retractions.
C. Advocacy that normalizes coercion or surveillance without consent-preserving safeguards.

Nomination Workflow (v0.1, low friction)
A. 2-page web form: link, summary, relevance to principles, disclosures, creator consent to be considered.
B. Anyone can nominate. Creators can self-nominate.
C. Nomination window: rolling; quarterly cutoffs for judging.

Judging & Rubric (weights total 100%)

Consent-First Design Insight â€” 20%

Epistemic Rigor (sources, accuracy, steel-manning) â€” 20%

Civic Impact Potential (audience reach + institutional relevance) â€” 15%

Clarity & Accessibility (teaches a non-expert) â€” 15%

Novelty/Originality (adds new angles) â€” 10%

Openness Alignment (open standards/commons literacy) â€” 10%

Safety & Ethics (harms considered, tradeoffs surfaced) â€” 10%
Scoring: each 1â€“5, multiply by weight, sum. Require â‰¥70/100 and no criterion <2.

Anti-Capture & COI Controls (non-negotiable)
A. Diverse 7-person jury: governance, journalism, OSS, civil society, creator, policy, layperson.
B. Juror COI disclosure per item. Recusal when any financial, editorial, or familial tie exists.
C. Publish short justification for each winner + anonymized rubric scores. Appeals window 14 days for factual error only.

Deliverables
A. Standards-based verifiable digital badge + page explaining why it won, with citations.
B. Small stipend per winner (even $500 is meaningful).
C. Media kit: press note, 60-sec clip, shareable quote cards.
D. Annual â€œanthologyâ€? page that stays online, versioned.

Pilot Timeline (90-day)
Month 1: finalize name, rubric, tiny jury, and nomination form. Announce.
Month 2: collect nominations, pre-screen, shortlist.
Month 3: jury scoring, winner write-ups, badges issued, public debrief.

Budget (pilot, lean)

Stipends: 5 winners Ã— $500 = $2,500.

Jury honoraria: 7 Ã— $200 = $1,400.

Design & web micro-site: $1,000.

Ops/contingency: $1,100.
Total: ~$6,000. Fund via small donor pool + sponsor who accepts zero editorial control.

Metrics That Matter (not vanity)
A. % of winners adopted in syllabi, policy memos, or internal briefings.
B. Post-award traffic lift and time-on-page for winners.
C. Number of open communities citing our rubric.
D. Diversity of creators and audiences reached.

Risks & Mitigations
A. Awards drift into brand theater. Mitigation: publish scoring + dissenting juror notes.
B. Ideological monoculture. Mitigation: require steel-manning of opposing views in write-ups.
C. Sponsor pressure. Mitigation: no sponsor veto, cap % of budget from any single funder.
D. Low trust in judging. Mitigation: transparent rubric, COI log, appeal on factual grounds.

Example Candidates (for rubric testing, not endorsements)
A. Satirical TV that surfaces consent vs coercion dynamics in tech governance.
B. Investigations into opaque algorithmic decision-making affecting citizens.
C. Explanations of open protocols that reduce platform lock-in.
D. Works that responsibly critique â€œopen-washâ€? or performative decentralization.

Comms Plan (tight loop)
A. Single â€œcall for nominationsâ€? post with concise criteria and examples.
B. Two milestone updates (shortlist, winners) with quotable pull-lines.
C. Encourage derivative explainers and classroom use. Provide educator notes.

License & Reuse
A. Winner write-ups under CC BY 4.0. Badges usable by winners with link-back.
B. No exclusive rights. We celebrate, not appropriate.

Nomination Form Fields (v0.1)
Title; link; creator name(s); publication date; category; 150-word summary; 150-word â€œhow it advances consent-first governanceâ€?; funding & COI disclosures; languages; contact email; optional supporting links.

Governance Hooks
A. HumanGate: Rick approves initial jury and rubric v0.1 before launch.
B. Annual rubric review with public change-log.
C. Sunset clause: if KPIs unmet for two cycles, pause and reassess.

Email Draft (ready to send)

Subject: 2â€“4h pro bono ask â€” SVG spinning globe hero for open-governance project (CoCivium)

Hi <FirstName>,

Iâ€™m Rick, stewarding an open-source, consent-first governance project called CoCivium. We need a small but high-impact asset: a smooth, low-CPU, SVG-based spinning globe for our repo/site hero. Your work on maps/geo projection is the gold standard, so Iâ€™m asking if youâ€™d consider a 2â€“4 hour, attribution-forward contribution.

Why itâ€™s worth your time.

Public good: weâ€™re building open civic infrastructure (no VC, no ads).

Your credit, link, and a short blurb at the top of our README/site.

Scope is tiny, decisions are fast, and weâ€™ll release under a permissive license.

Deliverable (tight scope).

1 SVG hero (512â€“1024 px) with CSS slow rotation (orthographic).

Landmasses from Natural Earth (TopoJSON, pre-simplified). No heavy JS.

Grayscale default, with a class toggle for an optional â€œflags fillâ€? variant.

File budget: ~50â€“80 KB. Respect prefers-reduced-motion.

License: CC-BY-4.0 (or your OSS-compatible choice).

What weâ€™ll hand you.
Clean TopoJSON, country IDs, and a tiny demo page. Iâ€™m the single approver and wonâ€™t bike-shed your craft.

If â€œgratisâ€? is a non-starter, tell me the micro-budget youâ€™d accept for this exact scope. Either way, Iâ€™d value your guidance so we donâ€™t ship trash.

If youâ€™re open, Iâ€™ll send a one-pager brief and the assets. Thanks for considering.

â€” Rick
Steward, CoCivium

### Card â€” Guardrails Badge (CoCivGuard) [P1]
**Lead.** Give newcomers a warm, positive badge to signal our guardrails (consent, reversibility, tone).
**Context.** Early channels will get noisy; we want a humanâ€‘feeling space with clear safety commitments.
**Proposal.**
- Draft badge copy & criteria (humanâ€‘first, reversibleâ€‘byâ€‘default, leastâ€‘privilege).
- Add to README + site; optional badge for Issues/PRs/Discussions.
- Pilot with small group; iterate from feedback.
**Risks.** Badge seen as gatekeeping â†’ frame as invitation; criteria drift.
**Dependencies.** Badge page + FAQ; aligns with Ethics Charter.
**Ask.** Review copy for warmth vs bureaucracy; mark READY when language feels right.

### Card â€” Matrix â†’ GitHub Discussions Relay (oneâ€‘way, gated) [P1]
**Lead.** Let folks ideate in Matrix using a simple **cardâ€‘md** format, then relay to Discussions once approved.
**Context.** GitHub UI can be intimidating; we reduce friction without losing human gates.
**Proposal.**
- Keep minimal relay script (dryâ€‘run by default); require frontâ€‘matter `status=approved`.
- Publish to `category=Ideas`; maintain human edit pass for tone.
- Keep `kill-switch` and `relay:live` flagging.
**Risks.** Accidental autoâ€‘posting (mitigate via dryâ€‘run + flag); source room spam (add qual. statement + rateâ€‘limit).
**Dependencies.** Matrix token, gh CLI auth, `ops/policy.yml`.
**Ask.** Pilot one more card; if the tone reads human, flip to READY.

### Card â€” Safety Gate on PRs (labels) [P1]
**Lead.** Block merges of highâ€‘risk changes unless explicitly `safety-approved`.
**Proposal.**
- Keep `.github/workflows/safety-gate.yml` active; scope to `risk:high` or `safety-review`.
- Add a oneâ€‘paragraph explainer in `CONTRIBUTING.md` and the PR template.
**Ask.** Nominate interim safety approver (Rick) and confirm label taxonomy.

### Card â€” Runtime Sanity (smoke + watchdog) [P1]
**Lead.** Minimal run tests to catch rot beyond lint.
**Proposal.** Create `tests/smoke` with 3â€“5 tiny checks; add `sanity.yml` to run on push/PR; gate merges later.

### Card â€” Succession Manifest & Heartbeat [P1]
**Lead.** Yearâ€‘andâ€‘aâ€‘day continuity via manual weekly heartbeat and a scheduled guardian.
**Proposal.** Keep a `user-heartbeat`; configure a â€œSuccessorâ€? workflow to raise an activation issue after >366d of silence.
**Metrics (90â€‘day postâ€‘activation).**
- Two tagged releases without founder reviews.
- â‰¥5 external PRs merged; median PR merge time <7 days.
- CI green â‰¥95%; security fix lead time <14 days.
- Maintainer pulse â‰¥7/10; no single maintainer >40% of merges.
**Files to add (later).** `docs/policies/STEPBACK.md`, `TRANSITION-NOTICE.md`, `CONSULTING.md`, `GOVERNANCE.md` (v2), `CODEOWNERS`, `SECURITY.md`, `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/fst-activation.md`.
**Ask.** Adopt â€œCommunityâ€‘Led â€¢ Founderâ€‘Emeritus â€¢ Rotation Enforcedâ€? badge and maintain neutral `PROVIDERS.md` (optâ€‘in, alphabetical, no endorsements).

### Card â€” Persona Tags (Left/Right/Whole Brain) [P2]
**Lead.** Use in Discussion posts to expose tradeâ€‘offs transparently; single human author.
**Proposal.** Tag `(left)/(right)/(whole)`; keep voice humane; avoid sockâ€‘puppeting.

### Card â€” Ops Policy & Kill Switch [P2]
**Lead.** Central `ops/policy.yml` and `ops/kill-switch` respected by relays/integrations.
**Proposal.** All automations consult policy; document permissions and uninstall steps.

### Card â€” BPOE / Workflow Record [P2]
**Lead.** Appendâ€‘only log of material decisions, guardrails, and ops changes (**Book of Process & Evidence**).
**Proposal.** Session blocks with links to issues/PRs; mirrors critical choices.

### Card â€” Incident & Pause Protocol [P3]
**Lead.** Define red flags, autoâ€‘pause conditions, comms template, and recovery checklist.
**Proposal.** Ship triggers, comms template, and recovery steps; keep optâ€‘out kill switch visible.

### Card â€” Contributor Onboarding Lite [P3]
**Lead.** â€œTwoâ€‘clickâ€? newcomer path: readâ€‘first â†’ idea template â†’ expectations.
**Proposal.** Readâ€‘first page, idea template, Matrix staging submission.

---

## New Card â€” Master Influence Flow Diagram (MIFD / â€œFlownoodleâ€?) [P1]
**Status.** Ideation â†’ Ready to stage after Grand Migration.
**Problem.** Thereâ€™s no neutral, global, personâ€‘first map showing how ideas travel across venues (public/private/hybrid) to become policy/standards/guidance; newcomers canâ€™t see where to intervene.
**Category + Naming.**
- **Category (public, generic):** â€œDemocracy Crowdsourcerâ€? â€” platform that turns citizen ideas into adoptable policy/standards (nonâ€‘proprietary to encourage forks).
- **Artifact name (public):** **Master Influence Flow Diagram (MIFD)**; short form **Master Influence Flowchart (MIF)**.
- **Internal nickname:** â€œFlownoodleâ€? (optional, not publicâ€‘facing).
**Forkâ€‘Friendliness & Competitor Signaling.**
- Invite forks and parallel implementations.
- Publish a **Compatibility Spec** (open license) + a **Compatible Implementations Directory**.
- Keep category generic; CoCivium is one implementation.
**README Category Block (pasteâ€‘ready).**
> **Category:** *Democracy Crowdsourcer.*
> CoCivium is one implementation of an open pattern where individuals convert ideas into adoptable policy/standards packs. We invite compatible forks and independent competitors. Shared goal: interoperable tooling and datasets so multiple projects can converge as society learns what works. Organizations do not govern CoCivium; they are recipients and venues to be influenced. One person, one voice.
**Patriotism & Localization.**
- Never USâ€‘centric in base art; provide localization layers (banner zone, RTL support, local accents, emblem slot).
- Ship a **countryâ€‘neutral default**; overlays document local reality and deviations.
**â€œIdeal vs. Is.â€?** Default MIFD is **normative** (target form). Overlays capture **reality** (fast paths, blockers, practical routes).
**Next Actions.**
- Draft v0 of the poster (neutral default) + overlay spec.
- Create the compatibility spec scaffold and directory.
- Add the README category block under the lede.

## Outreach â€” Dream Team Pack (ops block)
**Purpose.** Ultraâ€‘brief, tailored notes to ~20 â€œdream teamâ€? contributors; simple reply requested (â€œis CoCivium needed; how would you reframe?â€?).
**Action plan.**
1) **Source contacts** via official org pages/roleâ€‘based mailboxes; log address + source + status.
2) **Oneâ€‘byâ€‘one sends** (no BCC); personalize salutation and one sentence on their work; paste the matching page; include repo URL; sign â€œRick â€” CoCivium (open, noncommercial).â€?
3) **Sequencing:** Core Framers â†’ Model Governance â†’ DPI/Cities â†’ Rights/Safety â†’ Conveners â†’ Polycentric/Coâ€‘ops.
4) **Subject lines:** use the perâ€‘page subject; keep under ~60 chars; no emojis/ALL CAPS.
5) **Tracking:** SentAt, AddressUsed, SourceOfAddress, Autoâ€‘Reply, ReplyReceived, NextStep (color replies that propose reframes).
6) **Followâ€‘ups:** 7 business days; one twoâ€‘line bump max.
7) **Safety/ethics:** only clearly public/roleâ€‘based addresses; if contact form only, submit there and log it.
8) **Attachments:** none in first note; **link** to repo and minimal 1â€‘pager when ready; keep total size <50 KB.
**Note.** Insert your repo URL into `{REPO_URL}` before sending.

## New/Updated â€” 2025-08-24 18:30 UTC

> Practical ops direction: **we now rely on the GitHub repo for all scheduled tasks**. All ChatGPT-scheduled tasks have been deleted to prevent noise and memory bloat. The repo posts **only when attention is needed**.

```card-md
---
title: Quiet Monitor (repo-native silent watch)
persona: ops
category: Infra
status: approved
provenance: .github/workflows/quiet-monitor.yml
---

**Lead.** Hourly checks for Actions failures, urgent-labeled Issues/PRs, and Discussions by others. **No keep-alives.** It posts a single comment to an **â€œOps Alert Inboxâ€?** issue only if something needs attention.

**Context.** Earlier checks were noisy. We consolidated reporting to a single thread in-repo and removed ChatGPT schedules.

**Proposal.**
- Keep **quiet-monitor** enabled on a cron (hourly).
- Alert conditions (lookback 120m):
  1) Actions completed with conclusions in `[failure, timed_out, cancelled, action_required, stale]`.
  2) Open Issues/PRs updated â‰¤120m with labels in `{urgent, p0, sev1, blocker}`.
  3) New Discussions posts/comments by non-`rickballard`.
- Post once per cycle into **Ops Alert Inbox**, mentioning `@rickballard`.
- Provide a manual **workflow_dispatch** input `force_alert=true` to test the pipe without noise.

**Risks.** Inbox can grow; mitigate by auto-collapsing via sections and closing monthly.

**Dependencies.** gh CLI on runner, `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` (default).

**Ask.** Confirm the inbox issue title you want (currently â€œOps Alert Inboxâ€?). Approve default mention list.
```

title: Monthly Digest (Ops & Community)
persona: ops
category: Reporting
status: draft
provenance: .github/workflows/monthly-digest.yml (planned)
---

**Lead.** A once-a-month summary (top failures, hot Issues/PRs, new Discussions) posted to a â€œMonthly Ops Digestâ€? issue. Optional email export later.

**Proposal.**
- Cron: `0 9 1 * *` (1st of month, 09:00 UTC).
- Aggregates: Actions failure counts, open urgent Issues/PRs, Discussions participation, and links.
- Outputs to a new issue; closes the prior monthâ€™s digest.
- Optional: matrix/email relay in future; off by default.
```

title: MIFD (Minimum Integrated Flow Demo)
persona: product
category: Milestone
status: draft
provenance: RickPad
---

**Lead.** A compact, end-to-end demo that proves the **flow works** across tools (repo â†’ CI â†’ Discussions â†’ docs). Not a feature dumpâ€”**a single happy path**.

**Proposal.**
- Define the flow: author â†’ PR â†’ checks â†’ discussion â†’ publish.
- Script the demo: commands + test data + short video script.
- Success = â€œone command to start, one PR to finish, one discussion to announce.â€?

**Risks.** Scope creep; keep to 10â€“15 minutes.

**Next.** Draft CLI script; pick a tiny change (e.g., README badge) and run it end-to-end.

title: GitHub Org for CoCivium
persona: community
category: Governance
status: proposal
provenance: org-migration plan
---

**Lead.** Move from a personal repo to a community-owned **GitHub Organization** for optics and onboarding.

**Proposal.**
- Create org **CoCivium** (or preferred) with public profile.
- Repos: `cocivium` (core), `cociv-ai-club` (community tools), `assets`, `ops`.
- Migrate current repo or transfer ownership; preserve issues/PRs.
- Add CODEOWNERS, org-level labels, and default workflows.

**Risks.** Link breakage; mitigate with GitHub redirects and README notes.

title: Naming Guardrails â€” â€œAI Clubâ€? vs â€œCoCivAIâ€?
persona: comms
category: Brand
status: draft
provenance: RickPad
---

**Lead.** Use **CoCivAI** to disambiguate from generic â€œAI Club(s).â€? Be friendly, avoid policingâ€”use **gentle persuasion**.

**Guidelines.**
- Prefer â€œCoCivAI (the CoCivium AI Club)â€? on first mention.
- Avoid implying affiliation with outside AI Clubs.
- If confusion arises, link to the org profile and README overview.

**Lead.** All automation runs in **GitHub Actions**. **ChatGPT scheduled tasks are disabled.**

**Policy.**
- Only alert on actionable events (see Quiet Monitor).
- No routine â€œall clearâ€? messages.
- Optional monthly digest for situational awareness.
