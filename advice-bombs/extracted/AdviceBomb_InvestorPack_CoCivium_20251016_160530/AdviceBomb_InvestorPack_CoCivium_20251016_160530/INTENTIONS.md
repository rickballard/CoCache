# INTENTIONS

- Fund the **public-good core** (grants/DAFs/PRIs/sponsorships) *without governance capture*.
- Finance **commercial modules** (e.g., CoAgent) via standard venture instruments while maintaining clean IP licensing and entity separation.
- Build a disciplined outreach funnel with weekly KPI reviews and messageâ€‘market fit testing across lanes (impact, angels/syndicates, strategics).
- Maintain transparency: publish governance principles, risks, and quarterly milestone reports.
