# Founder Talk – 6 Minutes (Script)

00:00–00:45 — Cold open: “We’re building civic‑grade infrastructure that stays unowned and transparent—starting with asteroid defense.”
00:45–02:00 — The problem: brittle, captured systems; AI accelerating risk and complexity.
02:00–03:00 — The solution: CoSuite — core (public good) + modules (commercial).
03:00–04:15 — The wedge: CADI pilot milestones, partners we seek, public‑artifact reporting.
04:15–05:15 — CoAgent: enterprise‑viable because it’s born from civic‑grade constraints.
05:15–06:00 — The ask: fund the core (impact) and partner/finance modules (returns).

CTA: Deck + 2‑pager links; calendly/contact; data room access upon request.
