## Impact / Grants
Subject: CoCivium: credible public‑good wedge (asteroid defense) + transparent governance

Hi {{Name}},

We’re building an unowned civic stack with a sober wedge in asteroid defense. We publish artifacts, keep the core capture‑resistant, and invite impact partners to shape the pilot. Deck + 2‑pager available; happy to share data room on request.

## Angels / Syndicates
Subject: CoAgent (enterprise‑viable because civic‑grade) – pre‑seed intro

Hi {{Name}},

CoAgent is an AI ops console born from civic‑grade constraints (auditability, governance). We’re hardening MVP alongside public‑good work. If this fits your thesis (AI infra/govtech), I’d value 20 minutes. Deck + 2‑pager attached.

## Strategics
Subject: Pilot partnership: audit‑ready AI ops from the civic stack

Hi {{Name}},

We’re aligning CoAgent to enterprise compliance pressures. Looking to co‑design pilots where auditability matters. Minimal integration; clear success criteria. Brief deck attached—open to a technical deep‑dive.
