   - Diagram: data flows, APIs, observability.

4) **Commercial Module: CoAgent**
   - Jobs-to-be-done, screenshots, early users/use‑cases, compliance posture.

5) **Traction & Social Proof**
   - Pilots, waitlist metrics, advisors (with credibility in space/govtech/AI).

6) **GTM & Distribution**
   - Community → institutions → enterprise.
