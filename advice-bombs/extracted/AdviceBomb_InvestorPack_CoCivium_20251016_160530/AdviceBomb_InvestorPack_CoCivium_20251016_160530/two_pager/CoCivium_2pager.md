# CoCivium – 2‑Pager (Draft)

**One‑liner:** An open, unowned civic stack with a credible beachhead in asteroid defense (CADI) and enterprise‑grade modules (e.g., CoAgent) that monetize without governance capture.

## Problem
Civic infrastructure is brittle, siloed, and capture‑prone. AI is arriving faster than governance can adapt.

## Solution
A transparent, forkable stack (CoSuite) with:
- **Core (public‑good):** standards, protocols, shared components.
- **Modules (commercial):** deployable tools like CoAgent for institutions.

## Why now
Space risk and AI operations both demand verifiable, audit‑ready collaboration. The same discipline that keeps the core capture‑resistant makes modules enterprise‑viable.

## Traction & Wedge
- CADI concept advancing toward pilot formation.
- CoAgent MVP path + prospective early users.
- Advisory bench formation (seeking named partners).

## Business
- Grants/DAFs/PRIs fund the core.
- Modules priced as SaaS + services; pilots convert to contracts.

## Governance (No‑Capture)
- Clean NPO ↔ for‑profit separation, IP licenses, transparent board practices, quarterly reports.

## Ask
- **Impact lane:** grants/sponsorships for CADI pilot + core components.
- **Commercial lane:** pre‑seed/seed or strategic pilots for CoAgent hardening.
