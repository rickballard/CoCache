# Governance Principles (No‑Capture)

- **Unowned core**: stewarded by an NPO with transparent bylaws and rotating independent oversight.
- **Clean separation**: NPO (core) and for‑profit (modules); no cross‑subsidy; arm’s‑length service agreements.
- **IP licensing**: permissive for the core; commercial licenses for modules; reversible if capture detected.
- **Transparency**: quarterly public reports; open metrics; public issue tracking.
- **Diversity of funding**: no single source >20% of operating budget.
- **Conflict policies**: public declarations; recusals; independent audits.
