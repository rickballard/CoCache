# RickPad — Consolidated Idea Cards & Ops Notes
_Prepared: 2025-08-22 00:08 UTC · Purpose: readable backlog for later inclusion in CoCivium Discussions (not an action list)._

## How to use
- Keep a **single** RickPad (this file). When a card is ready for Discussions, mark `status=READY` and we’ll prep the port text in your voice.
- We iterate here until a card is **APPROVED FOR DISCUSSION**; then we export to GitHub Discussions and remove it from RickPad.
- Each Idea Card uses: **Lead · Context · Proposal · Risks · Dependencies · Ask**.

## Idea Cards


Idea Card:
Make www.CoCivium.org, a long read website that pulls in chunks from the repo every time it builds a document, and uses cached chunks if those chunks seem to be incumbered or messed up.  We could perhaps use zero-build Docsify pages set in small chunks.

Idea Card:
Idea Card — Pro-bono SVG Spinning Globe Hero (Outreach Sequence)

Purpose. Secure a smooth, lightweight, attribution-worthy SVG spinning globe hero for CoCivium, ideally via a small pro-bono contribution from a civic-minded dataviz/cartography expert. Fallback: micro-budget for the same scope.
Timebox. 2–4 hours contributor effort. Internal prep ≤60 minutes.
Success Criteria. 1) Delivered SVG ≤80 KB, low-CPU, smooth rotation, accessible. 2) Attribution line merged in README/site. 3) Optional “flags fill” variant scaffolded.

Outreach Sequence (serial, one at a time)

Prep (once). Confirm brief, assets, and attribution slot (see checklists).

Target #1: Philippe “Fil” Rivière — Contact: [public email on file].

Target #2: Jason Davies — Contact: [public email on file].

Target #3: Ian “enjalot” Johnson — Contact: [public email on file].

Target #4 (paid-leaning): Nadieh Bremer — Contact: [public email on file].

Target #5 (inputs focus): Matthew Bloch (map/topology prep) — Contact: [public email on file].

If all pass or no reply, post the brief to Open Source Design + DVS Slack (#help-wanted) and Code for All.

Cadence. One email at a time. Wait 3 business days for a response before moving to the next. If “busy now,” offer the micro-budget or ask for a short consult to bless the approach.

Deliverable (tight scope)

Format: Single SVG (512–1024 px square), CSS-driven slow rotation (orthographic).

Data: Natural Earth landmasses via TopoJSON, pre-simplified (we provide).

Perf: Smooth rotation, no jerkiness. No heavy JS. Respect prefers-reduced-motion.

Style: Grayscale default; class-toggle hook for optional “flags fill” on selected countries.

Budget: Target ≤80 KB SVG.

License: CC-BY-4.0 (or contributor’s OSS-compatible preference).

What We Provide (to de-risk the ask)

Clean TopoJSON + country IDs.

Tiny demo page and class hooks.

Single decision-maker (Rick). One revision pass. No bike-shedding.

Prominent attribution at top of README/site with link + one-line bio.

Email Draft (ready to send)

Subject: 2–4h pro bono ask — SVG spinning globe hero for open-governance project (CoCivium)

Hi <FirstName>,

I’m Rick, stewarding an open-source, consent-first governance project called CoCivium. We need a small but high-impact asset: a smooth, low-CPU, SVG-based spinning globe for our repo/site hero. Your work on maps/geo projection is the gold standard, so I’m asking if you’d consider a 2–4 hour, attribution-forward contribution.

Why it’s worth your time.

Public good: we’re building open civic infrastructure (no VC, no ads).

Your credit, link, and a short blurb at the top of our README/site.

Scope is tiny, decisions are fast, and we’ll release under a permissive license.

Deliverable (tight scope).

1 SVG hero (512–1024 px) with CSS slow rotation (orthographic).

Landmasses from Natural Earth (TopoJSON, pre-simplified). No heavy JS.

Grayscale default, with a class toggle for an optional “flags fill” variant.

File budget: ~50–80 KB. Respect prefers-reduced-motion.

License: CC-BY-4.0 (or your OSS-compatible choice).

What we’ll hand you.
Clean TopoJSON, country IDs, and a tiny demo page. I’m the single approver and won’t bike-shed your craft.

If “gratis” is a non-starter, tell me the micro-budget you’d accept for this exact scope. Either way, I’d value your guidance so we don’t ship trash.

If you’re open, I’ll send a one-pager brief and the assets. Thanks for considering.

Idea Card: Productize Issue-Resolution Chat Format

Concept: Develop a structured chat format for AI-assisted issue resolution.

Functionality: Users discuss issues verbally with their AI, which generates an evolving position paper alongside the dialogue.

Collaboration: Enables contributions from other users and their AIs to refine the position paper.

Outcome: The finalized position paper is converted into a PR for GitHub and sent to CoCivium or similar platforms.


Idea Card: CoCivium's Long-Term Purpose

Platform Concept: CoCivium as a policy creation and action center.

Possible Labels:

Crowdsourced Democracy Platform

Digital Augmented Society Enabler

Record of Last Resort for Civic Frameworks

Blockchain Voting and Anonymous Voting Vector



Idea Card: Refine Mission Statement

Mission Statement: Enable the regulation of an agentic, meritocratic, democratic digital society.

Purpose: Clarify CoCivium’s core objectives.

Challenges Addressed: Assist in defining CoCivium’s identity, branding, and taglines.

Let me know if this captures it.



Idea Card: CoCivium Master Plan

Purpose: Create a comprehensive document outlining CoCivium’s vision, principles, and objectives.

Components:

Vision and mission statements.

Phases and objectives.

Performance tracking criteria.

Success criteria.

Assumptions.

SWOT analysis.

Distributed leadership model.

Scope:

Define what CoCivium does not do (e.g., coerce, enforce laws, align politically or commercially, endorse hatred, claim exclusive ownership, operate opaquely, harm humanity).

Highlight assumptions and acknowledge weaknesses.






### Card — Guardrails Badge (CoCivGuard) [P1]
**Lead.** Give newcomers a warm, positive badge to signal our guardrails (consent, reversibility, tone).  
**Context.** Early channels will get noisy; we want a human‑feeling space with clear safety commitments.  
**Proposal.**
- Draft badge copy & criteria (human‑first, reversible‑by‑default, least‑privilege).
- Add to README + site; optional badge for Issues/PRs/Discussions.
- Pilot with small group; iterate from feedback.
**Risks.** Badge seen as gatekeeping → frame as invitation; criteria drift.  
**Dependencies.** Badge page + FAQ; aligns with Ethics Charter.  
**Ask.** Review copy for warmth vs bureaucracy; mark READY when language feels right.

### Card — Matrix → GitHub Discussions Relay (one‑way, gated) [P1]
**Lead.** Let folks ideate in Matrix using a simple **card‑md** format, then relay to Discussions once approved.  
**Context.** GitHub UI can be intimidating; we reduce friction without losing human gates.  
**Proposal.**
- Keep minimal relay script (dry‑run by default); require front‑matter `status=approved`.
- Publish to `category=Ideas`; maintain human edit pass for tone.
- Keep `kill-switch` and `relay:live` flagging.  
**Risks.** Accidental auto‑posting (mitigate via dry‑run + flag); source room spam (add qual. statement + rate‑limit).  
**Dependencies.** Matrix token, gh CLI auth, `ops/policy.yml`.  
**Ask.** Pilot one more card; if the tone reads human, flip to READY.

### Card — Safety Gate on PRs (labels) [P1]
**Lead.** Block merges of high‑risk changes unless explicitly `safety-approved`.  
**Proposal.**
- Keep `.github/workflows/safety-gate.yml` active; scope to `risk:high` or `safety-review`.
- Add a one‑paragraph explainer in `CONTRIBUTING.md` and the PR template.
**Ask.** Nominate interim safety approver (Rick) and confirm label taxonomy.

### Card — Runtime Sanity (smoke + watchdog) [P1]
**Lead.** Minimal run tests to catch rot beyond lint.  
**Proposal.** Create `tests/smoke` with 3–5 tiny checks; add `sanity.yml` to run on push/PR; gate merges later.

### Card — Succession Manifest & Heartbeat [P1]
**Lead.** Year‑and‑a‑day continuity via manual weekly heartbeat and a scheduled guardian.  
**Proposal.** Keep a `user-heartbeat`; configure a “Successor” workflow to raise an activation issue after >366d of silence.  
**Metrics (90‑day post‑activation).**
- Two tagged releases without founder reviews.
- ≥5 external PRs merged; median PR merge time <7 days.
- CI green ≥95%; security fix lead time <14 days.
- Maintainer pulse ≥7/10; no single maintainer >40% of merges.
**Files to add (later).** `docs/policies/STEPBACK.md`, `TRANSITION-NOTICE.md`, `CONSULTING.md`, `GOVERNANCE.md` (v2), `CODEOWNERS`, `SECURITY.md`, `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/fst-activation.md`.  
**Ask.** Adopt “Community‑Led • Founder‑Emeritus • Rotation Enforced” badge and maintain neutral `PROVIDERS.md` (opt‑in, alphabetical, no endorsements).

### Card — Persona Tags (Left/Right/Whole Brain) [P2]
**Lead.** Use in Discussion posts to expose trade‑offs transparently; single human author.  
**Proposal.** Tag `(left)/(right)/(whole)`; keep voice humane; avoid sock‑puppeting.

### Card — Ops Policy & Kill Switch [P2]
**Lead.** Central `ops/policy.yml` and `ops/kill-switch` respected by relays/integrations.  
**Proposal.** All automations consult policy; document permissions and uninstall steps.

### Card — BPOE / Workflow Record [P2]
**Lead.** Append‑only log of material decisions, guardrails, and ops changes (**Book of Process & Evidence**).  
**Proposal.** Session blocks with links to issues/PRs; mirrors critical choices.

### Card — Incident & Pause Protocol [P3]
**Lead.** Define red flags, auto‑pause conditions, comms template, and recovery checklist.  
**Proposal.** Ship triggers, comms template, and recovery steps; keep opt‑out kill switch visible.

### Card — Contributor Onboarding Lite [P3]
**Lead.** “Two‑click” newcomer path: read‑first → idea template → expectations.  
**Proposal.** Read‑first page, idea template, Matrix staging submission.

## New Card — Master Influence Flow Diagram (MIFD / “Flownoodle”) [P1]
**Status.** Ideation → Ready to stage after Grand Migration.  
**Problem.** There’s no neutral, global, person‑first map showing how ideas travel across venues (public/private/hybrid) to become policy/standards/guidance; newcomers can’t see where to intervene.  
**Category + Naming.**
- **Category (public, generic):** “Democracy Crowdsourcer” — platform that turns citizen ideas into adoptable policy/standards (non‑proprietary to encourage forks).
- **Artifact name (public):** **Master Influence Flow Diagram (MIFD)**; short form **Master Influence Flowchart (MIF)**.
- **Internal nickname:** “Flownoodle” (optional, not public‑facing).
**Fork‑Friendliness & Competitor Signaling.**
- Invite forks and parallel implementations.
- Publish a **Compatibility Spec** (open license) + a **Compatible Implementations Directory**.
- Keep category generic; CoCivium is one implementation.
**README Category Block (paste‑ready).**
> **Category:** *Democracy Crowdsourcer.*  
> CoCivium is one implementation of an open pattern where individuals convert ideas into adoptable policy/standards packs. We invite compatible forks and independent competitors. Shared goal: interoperable tooling and datasets so multiple projects can converge as society learns what works. Organizations do not govern CoCivium; they are recipients and venues to be influenced. One person, one voice.
**Patriotism & Localization.**
- Never US‑centric in base art; provide localization layers (banner zone, RTL support, local accents, emblem slot).
- Ship a **country‑neutral default**; overlays document local reality and deviations.
**“Ideal vs. Is.”** Default MIFD is **normative** (target form). Overlays capture **reality** (fast paths, blockers, practical routes).  
**Next Actions.**
- Draft v0 of the poster (neutral default) + overlay spec.
- Create the compatibility spec scaffold and directory.
- Add the README category block under the lede.

## Outreach — Dream Team Pack (ops block)
**Purpose.** Ultra‑brief, tailored notes to ~20 “dream team” contributors; simple reply requested (“is CoCivium needed; how would you reframe?”).  
**Action plan.**
1) **Source contacts** via official org pages/role‑based mailboxes; log address + source + status.  
2) **One‑by‑one sends** (no BCC); personalize salutation and one sentence on their work; paste the matching page; include repo URL; sign “Rick — CoCivium (open, noncommercial).”  
3) **Sequencing:** Core Framers → Model Governance → DPI/Cities → Rights/Safety → Conveners → Polycentric/Co‑ops.  
4) **Subject lines:** use the per‑page subject; keep under ~60 chars; no emojis/ALL CAPS.  
5) **Tracking:** SentAt, AddressUsed, SourceOfAddress, Auto‑Reply, ReplyReceived, NextStep (color replies that propose reframes).  
6) **Follow‑ups:** 7 business days; one two‑line bump max.  
7) **Safety/ethics:** only clearly public/role‑based addresses; if contact form only, submit there and log it.  
8) **Attachments:** none in first note; **link** to repo and minimal 1‑pager when ready; keep total size <50 KB.  
**Note.** Insert your repo URL into `{REPO_URL}` before sending.
