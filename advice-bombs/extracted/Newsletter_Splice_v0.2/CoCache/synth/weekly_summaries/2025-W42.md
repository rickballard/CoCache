## This week in CoCivium (<=150 words)
Open finance guidance matured, participatory budgeting produced measurable acceptability gains, and a CMS CVE requires immediate posture checks.
Together these signals nudge FinFlow toward a minimal pilot framing (fraud-proofing + auditability), while mini-publics continue to validate frame shifts.
Security remains a first-order guardrail: review exposure to municipal CMS v4.x and apply the vendor patch.

### Top Signals (<=5, 2-3 lines each)
1) OECD open finance dashboards - adds indicator minima and anomaly flags; improves FinFlow forkability and evidence. [link](https://www.oecd.org/gov/open-government/open-finance-dashboards-2025.htm)
2) City X mini-public - +12pp acceptance post-deliberation; publishes instruments we can reuse. [link](https://example.org/cityx/pb-report-2025)
3) CVE-2025-12345 - auth bypass in municipal CMS v4.x; patch now; verify FinFlow portal isolation. [link](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-12345)

### Diffusion Watch (<=3)
- City X published a full mini-public protocol usable for our FinFlow framing. [link](https://example.org/cityx/pb-report-2025)

### Risk & Guardrails (<=3)
- CVE-2025-12345: patch available; require audit trail verification post-update. [link](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-12345)

### Recommended Actions (<=5 checkboxes)
- [ ] Frame A/B test: "waste-cutting & fraud-proofing" vs "open finance & trust"
- [ ] Mini-public (municipal ops) with City X instrument
- [ ] CMS exposure check and patch confirmation
- [ ] Add OECD indicators to FinFlow minimal bundle
