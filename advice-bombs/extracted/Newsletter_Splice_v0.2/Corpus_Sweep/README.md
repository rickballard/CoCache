# Corpus_Sweep - LiveWisdom & Canon

Defines how CoSuite ingests latest wisdom, curates it, and converts it into concise, auditable assets: weekly briefs, citations, and small deltas to CoCore.
- Thin assets, thick links.
- Quotas to prevent bloat.
- Two-tier policy: CoCache (rotating ingest) vs CoCore/Corpus_Sweep (durable, human-reviewed).

See `livewisdom.policy.yml` and `live_sources.yml`.
