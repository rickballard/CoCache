> TL;DR - Open finance guidance matured; a deliberative panel boosted acceptance; and a CMS CVE requires immediate checks. FinFlow framing strengthens; security posture tightens.

## Top Signals
1) OECD open finance dashboards - adds indicator minima and anomaly flags; improves FinFlow forkability and evidence. [link](https://www.oecd.org/gov/open-government/open-finance-dashboards-2025.htm)
2) City X mini-public - +12pp acceptance; instruments published and reusable. [link](https://example.org/cityx/pb-report-2025)
3) CVE-2025-12345 - auth bypass in municipal CMS v4.x; patch now; verify portal isolation. [link](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-12345)

## Diffusion Watch
- City X published a full mini-public protocol useful for FinFlow framing. [link](https://example.org/cityx/pb-report-2025)

## Risk & Guardrails
- CVE-2025-12345: patch available; require audit trail verification post-update. [link](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-12345)

## Recommended Actions
- [ ] Frame A/B test: "waste-cutting & fraud-proofing" vs "open finance & trust"
- [ ] Mini-public (municipal ops) with City X instrument
- [ ] CMS exposure check and patch confirmation
- [ ] Add OECD indicators to FinFlow minimal bundle
