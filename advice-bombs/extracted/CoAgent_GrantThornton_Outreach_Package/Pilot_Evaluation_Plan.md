# CoAgent × Grant Thornton (Canada): Pilot Evaluation Plan

**Objective**: Validate whether CoAgent reduces cycle‑time and increases quality on one small, non‑sensitive internal workflow within 2–4 weeks.

## Scope
- One “paper‑cut” workflow (e.g., weekly exec brief, RAID summary, slide clean‑up, CSV→chart refresh).
- Non‑prod workstation; sample/redacted files only.
- No automated system changes; human‑in‑the‑loop for any outputs leaving the sandbox.

## Success Criteria
- ≥30% cycle‑time reduction measured on at least 3 consecutive runs.
- Reproducible outputs: same prompt → same outcome; prompt/version captured.
- Governance: explicit human checkpoints; artifact logs retained in a local folder/repo.

## Roles
- **Practitioner (“vibe‑coder”)**: 1–2 hrs/week hands‑on.
- **Transformation lead**: confirms guardrails, defines success metrics.
- **Rick**: enablement, prompt engineering patterns, measurement template.

## Cadence
- Week 0: 30‑min kickoff (objectives, guardrails, metrics).
- Weeks 1–3: Build/iterate; weekly 25‑min check‑in.
- Week 4: Readout with metrics and keep/kill/expand decision.

## Deliverables
- Prompt + runbook (Markdown), example inputs/outputs, and a short “how‑we‑did‑it” note.
- Before/after time logs and a 1‑page readout.
- Everything licensed permissively; artifacts remain with Grant Thornton.
