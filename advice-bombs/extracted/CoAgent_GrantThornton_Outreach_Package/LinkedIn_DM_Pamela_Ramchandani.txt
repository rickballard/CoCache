Hi Pamela — we’re next‑door neighbours. I’m building a small, always‑free tool (CoAgent) that helps practitioners turn natural‑language prompts into repeatable, governed workflows using the tools they already have. 

Would you be open to a 30‑min, no‑obligation demo for someone on your Business Transformation team? We can run a tiny 2–4 week pilot on non‑sensitive data; you keep any assets we create, and we get candid feedback. If it’s not useful, you still get a micro‑workflow you can reuse.

If that’s worth a look, I’ll send a one‑pager and set up a time.
