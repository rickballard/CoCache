# CoCivium — Neutral Summary (150–200 words)

CoCivium (https://cocivium.org/) is an open‑source framework for consent‑first governance designed for hybrid teams that include both humans and AI systems. It provides simple, portable process modules that make decisions traceable and reversible: decision logs, formal objection handling, and “policy‑as‑code” rules that can be audited and rolled back when better practices emerge. The aim is to help groups adopt lightweight, transparent governance without importing politics or heavy bureaucracy, and to make policy execution explainable to non‑experts.

CoCivium is suitable for pilots in nonprofits, open‑source projects, online communities, and product or marketplace policy teams. Early work focuses on human‑gated approvals around AI‑assisted workflows, ensuring clear lines of accountability. The project is community‑led and seeks feedback from practitioners running real‑world pilots.
