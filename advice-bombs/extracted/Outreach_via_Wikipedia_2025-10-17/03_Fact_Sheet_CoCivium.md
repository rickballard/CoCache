## Key facts (verifiable)
1. Open‑source framework providing portable governance modules (decision logs, objection handling, rollback).
2. “Policy‑as‑code”: rules expressed in an auditable form; reversible when practices improve.
3. Focus on **human‑gated AI** workflows to keep accountability with people.
4. Target pilots: nonprofits, open‑source projects, online communities, and product/marketplace policy teams.
5. Emphasis on explainability and minimal bureaucracy; decisions are traceable to sources and rationales.
6. Early‑stage; seeking small pilots and practitioner feedback to harden modules.
7. Neutral documentation lives at the project site; source code and issues on GitHub.
8. Governance posture: consent‑first, objection‑aware, reversible by design.
