Date: 2025-10-17

**Objective:** Achieve Wikipedia notability for CoCivium by securing **independent, staff-written coverage**, then submit a neutral article via **AfC**.

**Canonical URL:** https://cocivium.org/

**Package map**
- `01_Checklist.md` — step-by-step admin checklist (do this in order)
- `02_Neutral_Summary.md` — paste into /about and media emails
- `03_Fact_Sheet_CoCivium.md` — 1‑page facts; export to PDF for reporters

**Hard rules:**
