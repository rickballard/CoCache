# AfC Submission Steps
1) Create a user sandbox and paste the neutral draft.
2) Inline‑cite **independent, staff‑written** coverage (≥2 sources).
3) Add project site and GitHub under External links (not as sources for claims).
4) Disclose any COI if you have one. Keep tone descriptive and dry.
5) Submit via Articles for Creation (AfC).
6) Address reviewer notes; remove promotional wording; ensure every non‑obvious claim is cited.
