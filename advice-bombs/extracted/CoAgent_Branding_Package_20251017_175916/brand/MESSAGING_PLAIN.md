# CoAgent Messaging Brief — Plain-Language Version (v1.1)

**Core line (H1):** **Your governance. BYO-AI.**  
**Subhead (plain):** A vendor-neutral **AI Trust Container** that lets you keep your rules, your records, and your options—no matter which AI you use.

---

## 1) What it is (in simple words)
CoAgent is a **container** for AI—like a **universal safety case**. You put AI inside it, and your **rules and receipts** travel with the AI wherever you run it.

> Analogy: Think **seatbelt that fits any car**. You can change cars (AI vendors), but your seatbelt (rules, logs, protections) stays the same.

## 2) Who it’s for (broader than tech)
- **Everyday users** (parents, caregivers, students): want **safe, private AI help** without being trapped by one company.  
- **Small businesses & nonprofits:** need **simple compliance and proof** without a big IT team.  
- **Teachers, health admins, social workers:** need **guardrails** for sensitive info and **receipts** for accountability.  
- **Execs & risk owners (CIO/CISO/Legal):** want **portability**, **audit-ready proof**, and **less lock-in**.  
- **Builders/AI platform teams:** want **one way** to enforce policy across many models.

## 3) The problem (stated so anyone gets it)
- Today, **each AI app has its own rules**. If you switch, you **lose your guardrails and your history**.  
- Vendors keep the **logs and controls**; you get **screenshots and hope**.  
- On “audit day” (a parent asking, a principal, a regulator, a donor), you can’t **prove** what happened.

**Plain truth:** If your rules and your records live at someone else’s company, **you don’t control them.**

## 4) The promise (what CoAgent gives you)
- **Policy once. Enforce everywhere.** (Your rules wrap any supported AI.)  
- **Repatriated data. Only you control it.** (Your logs, receipts, and settings live with you.)  
- **Switch models. Keep governance.** (Change providers without losing oversight.)  
- **Evidence-grade receipts.** (Printable, shareable proof of what happened.)

## 5) Differentiators (no tech-speak)
- **Vendor-neutral by design:** We sit **above** any single provider.  
- **Portable guardrails:** Your rules **move with you**.  
- **Receipts, not promises:** You get **signed records** you can show to anyone.  
- **Grows with you:** Start simple, add stricter controls as needed.

## 6) Approved short lines (use anywhere)
- **Your governance. BYO-AI.**  
- **Trust the container, not the vendor.**  
- **Policy once. Enforce everywhere.**  
- **Switch models. Keep governance.**  
- **Explainable. Enforceable. Portable.**

## 7) Coverage language (safe + human)
- **Public site:** *Continuously evolving support; integrates with your existing processes, workflows, systems, and apps.*  
- **Footnote (legal-safe):** *Works with supported providers and models; coverage expands over time.*

## 8) Feature → benefit (human version)
- **Rules you set, in one place** → less rework, fewer mistakes.  
- **Receipts you own** → proof for parents, bosses, clients, regulators.  
- **Model-agnostic** → choose the best AI today, change it tomorrow.  
- **Sensitive-info filters** → fewer leaks, fewer headaches.

## 9) Objections (simple replies)
- **“Vendors already have guardrails.”** → Those don’t **travel** when you switch. Yours do.  
- **“Will this slow us down?”** → Start light; turn on stricter rules later.  
- **“More lock-in?”** → Your rules and receipts live with **you**, not us.  
- **“Too technical.”** → Defaults work out of the box; advanced options when you’re ready.

## 10) Tone & voice
- **Direct, plain, proof-based.** Short sentences. No jargon.  
- Prefer **“proof/receipts/evidence”** over “trust us.”

## 11) Website hero (plain)
**Your governance. BYO-AI.**  
A vendor-neutral AI Trust Container. Keep your rules, your records, and your options—no matter which AI you use.  
- Policy once, enforce everywhere  
- Repatriated data, only you control  
- Evidence-grade receipts

**CTA:** Get the container

## 12) Case-study story (for non-technical readers)
**“Maya’s Homework Club” (community nonprofit, 3 staff, 40 kids)**  
Maya runs after-school tutoring. Volunteers use AI to draft lesson plans and explain tough topics. Each tool had different settings. Sometimes an explanation was **wrong or biased**. Parents asked, “**What did you show my kid?**” Maya had **no clear records**.

They added **CoAgent**—the **AI Trust Container**. Volunteers still pick whichever AI explains best. But **Maya’s rules** (no personal data, no violent content, age-appropriate tone) **wrap every AI** the same way.

- When a parent asks, Maya prints a **receipt**: which AI was used, what it said, what was filtered.  
- A volunteer tried a new provider; **no retraining** needed—same rules applied automatically.  
- A grant auditor visited; Maya showed **one folder of receipts**. Funding renewed.

**Outcome (90 days):** fewer parent complaints, faster prep time, one consistent rulebook, **proof on demand**. No vendor lock-in.

## 13) Movement ethos placement (optional, footline)
*No corruption. No coercion. No crowns.*

## 14) Enterprise appendix (one paragraph)
CoAgent is a **vendor-neutral AI governance container** that centralizes policy, generates **evidence-grade receipts**, and keeps guardrails **portable across supported models and providers**—so teams can **switch models without losing oversight** while maintaining privacy via **data repatriation**.
