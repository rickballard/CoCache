# Visual Identity Notes (Cues for Designers)

- **Metaphor:** container “above the vendors” (stack/overlay motif).  
- **Portability:** connector glyphs; interchangeable model badges.  
- **Evidence:** checksum/receipt iconography (receipt, seal, hash).  
- **Tone:** neutral core palette; vendor colors are accents (swappable).  
- **Typography:** crisp sans; short lines; active verbs; avoid hype.  
- **Lockup:** 
  - Primary: **Your governance. BYO-AI.**
  - Secondary: **AI Trust Container**
- **Badge idea:** “Evidence-grade” seal used next to exports/logs.
