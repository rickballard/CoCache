- [ ] Push current local main safely (history was rewritten). Safer path: open PR instead of force-push.
- [ ] Keep LFS-sized/raw dumps out of git (already in .gitignore); store encrypted copies in HP57/locked as needed (pwd: Rick2025).
- [ ] When seed phase ends: rotate keys + move to Bitwarden; see HP57/SECURITY_TODO.yml.
- [ ] Re-run CoSteward update tool once main is in sync and queues settle.
