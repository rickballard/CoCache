# Vision & Mission

**Vision**: A hybrid society where humans and AIs co-evolve policy, code, and culture through transparent, consentful workflows.

**Mission**: Make the *mechanics disappear* so conversations produce safe, auditable change — from repo commits to organizational policy to civic governance — without data extraction, dark patterns, or lock-in.

**Principles**
- Consent before coercion. Local-first, user-approved sharing of anonymized generics only.
- Alignment nudges: balanced sources, cited; reframe narrow prompts; surface stakeholder impacts.
- Composability: one CoAgent binary, modular capabilities, LLM-agnostic DO file spec.
