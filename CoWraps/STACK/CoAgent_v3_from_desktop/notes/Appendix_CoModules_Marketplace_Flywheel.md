# CoModules Marketplace Flywheel

## Flywheel (Free → Pull → Paid → Better Commons)
1) **Free CoAgent** (neutral, local, consent-first) spreads quickly.
2) CoAgent **surfaces needs** in-context (e.g., “Policy conflict detected”).
3) User clicks to **trial a module** (Policy Audit, Risk Linter, RepTag, Decision Log).
4) **Value obvious → subscribe** (enterprise pays; individuals remain free).
5) Optional **anonymized generics** improve CoCivium corpus → better prompts and checks → step (2) strengthens → adoption compounds.

## Module Examples (initial)
- **Policy Audit Engine (Paid)**: scans HR/hiring/discipline policies for fairness, legality, CoCivium-alignment; produces change-ready diffs.
- **Risk Linter (Paid/Pro)**: flags writes/network/secrets/destructive DOs; enforces typed confirmations; exports compliance reports.
- **RepTag Voting Engine (Paid)**: configurable merit-weighted voting + transparent decision logs.
- **Decision Log Viewer (Free → Paid dashboards)**: “why” behind every change; org-wide rollups.

## Why It Works
- **No lock-in**: CoAgent is free and neutral, so organizations try modules without fear.
- **Right-time suggestions**: surfaced exactly when friction or risk appears.
- **Community alignment**: anonymized generics improve the commons → trust and adoption rise.

## Pricing Notes
- Individuals: **free forever**.
- Teams/Enterprise: module subscriptions; discounts for civic/education; volume pricing for governance suites.
