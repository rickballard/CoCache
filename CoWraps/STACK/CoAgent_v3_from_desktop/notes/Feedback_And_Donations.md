# Feedback, Donations, and Enterprise Funnel

## In‑Product Feedback
- Add a compact “Thanks” slider and quick feedback prompt in the launcher.
- Store structured feedback locally at `feedback/entries/*.json` and optionally open a prefilled issue.

### Feedback JSON (local)
- See `schemas/feedback.schema.json`

## Donations
- Add a small “Buy me a coffee” style link (GitHub Sponsors / Ko‑fi).

## Enterprise Lead-In
- Offer a “Use at Work?” toggle: with consent, prefill an email to procurement or open a request form.
- Never auto-send; user explicitly opts in.
