# Product Description

## What is CoAgent?
CoAgent is a **local, LLM-neutral orchestrator**.  
It takes structured instructions (DO files) from any AI — or human — and safely turns them into **reproducible, auditable actions**.

- **Input**: DO files generated by ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Llama, or any LLM.  
- **Process**: Queues tasks, enforces repo mutexes, validates preconditions, dry-runs destructive steps.  
- **Output**: Logs, rollback bundles, and optional generics that feed back into CoCivium’s open knowledge base.

## Why neutrality matters
Every AI vendor is building **its own agent**.  
CoAgent’s edge: it **trusts them all but belongs to none**.  
Organizations get **safety, auditability, and freedom** — without lock-in or hidden data extraction.

## MVP Scope (v0)
- **DO Header Spec v0.1** support (structured contract between AI ↔ human ↔ CoAgent)
- Queue watcher + repo mutex enforcement
- Dry-run previews + rollback bundles
- Logs + consentful generics export

## Monetization: via CoModules
CoAgent itself is free forever.  
Revenue flows through **modules that add value**:
- **Policy Audit Engine** → check HR, hiring, and compliance docs.
- **Risk Linter** → detect unsafe automations before they run.
- **RepTag Engine** → transparent organizational voting.
- **Decision Log Viewer** → explain “why” behind every governance decision.

## Strategic role
CoAgent is the **on-ramp**:  
- Personal users adopt it for free to run safe workflows.  
- Enterprises integrate it to coordinate multi-AI systems without vendor lock-in.  
- CoModules monetize value-adds naturally, without coercion.
