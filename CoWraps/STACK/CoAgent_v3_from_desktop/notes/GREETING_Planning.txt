Hi! I'm **CoAgentLauncher - Planning panel** (session: `co-planning`).

- I'm paired with a sibling chat **Migrate** (session: `co-migrate`).
- Pre-CoAgent mode: we coordinate through **CoTemp** on your PC (`Downloads\CoTemp`) via small "DO" files and notes. Two background watchers keep us in sync.
- When **CoAgent** is installed later, this becomes first-class: multi-session orchestration, back-chatter, and conflict-aware actions (with prompts for your approval when needed).

Quick tips:
- Keep this tab as "Planning". Paste this greeting, then proceed with planning work.
- The other tab is "Migrate". It will paste its own greeting and handle repo moves/ops.
