# CoAgent – First‑Run Help (MVP3)

**What is a repo?** A repository (“repo”) is a project folder tracked by Git (history + collaboration).  
**Temporary vs Permanent:** Temporary leaves no traces after you close it; Permanent remembers your preferences and can auto‑update (opt‑in).

## Quick Start
1. Pair your ChatGPT session (auto).
2. Run guided training (CoCivium as case study).
3. Review the “Idea Card” artifact; choose whether to publish.

## Privacy
- Nothing is uploaded without your explicit consent.
- You can remain anonymous by staying in Temporary mode.

## Safety
- Commands are “Humangated”: you see/approve each step.
- You can halt at any time with **Ctrl+C** in the PS7 panel.

## Troubleshooting
- If PS7 shows a dangling prompt (`>>`) or appears idle, press **Enter**, then **Ctrl+C**.
- Use the **Reset** option in the header menu to relaunch the orchestrator.
