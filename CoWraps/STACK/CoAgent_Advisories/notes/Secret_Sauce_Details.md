# Secret Sauce Details (Internal Only)

## Monetization Levers
- **Enterprise Team Licenses**: RBAC successor governance, audit dashboards.
- **Private Repo Ops**: Secure GitHub Enterprise integrations.
- **Custom Builds**: For-profit connectors, air-gapped deployments.
- **Marketplace**: Vetted CoPayloads, policy packs, shared revenue.
- **Support Services**: Implementation, evaluation tuning, governance consulting.

## RBAC Successor Models
- **Contextual Trust Contracts (CTCs):** Time-bounded, task-specific contracts.
- **Dynamic Affordance Control (DAC):** Permissions as affordances, revocable mid-run.
- **Congruence Scoring:** Visible scoring for alignment with policies and norms.

These models distinguish CoAgent from competitors who rely on legacy RBAC.
