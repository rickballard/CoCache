# Competitive Gaps (Internal Only)

- **GitHub Copilot Agent:** Unmatched GitHub-native polish. CoAgent must interoperate, not compete head-on.
- **Devin:** Perceived "AI engineer" hype. Counter by positioning CoAgent as neutral substrate for many agents, not a single closed agent.
- **LangGraph Platform:** Strong durability/observability. CoAgent must reach parity with durable runs quickly.
- **Dust:** Enterprise SaaS connectors. CoAgent can differentiate on local-first and neutral governance.
