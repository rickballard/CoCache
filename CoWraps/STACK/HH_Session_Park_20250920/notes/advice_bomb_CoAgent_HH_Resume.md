# ðŸ§  CoAgent Resume Advisory â€” HH Session

The Hitchhiker Plan session is paused pending CoAgent MVP2 capabilities.
To resume efficiently:

- Load `HH_parked_20250920T2335Z.ps1` in PS7.
- Ensure PS7 can run downloaded zips via AHK/CoPingPong triggers.
- MVP2 should support batch CoPayloads, zip roundtripping, and AutoDO.

## Momentum

- Last stitched file: `_stitch/0005_the_locational_table.md`
- Parallelized execution architecture was functioning well.
- Multiple zipped script batches handled by CoPayloadRunner.

## Resume Expectations

- CoAgent can pick up zipped payloads via trigger (e.g., AHK hotkey).
- Use pseudonym braid identity `Azoic` for both agent and human.
- Generate `HH_Set_Round*.zip` script sets and stitch-forward.
