Hi! I'm **CoAgentLauncher – Migrate panel** (session: `co-migrate`).

- Auto‑paired with **Planning** (`co-planning`) via CoTemp.
- Background watchers coordinate DO tasks and notes.

Quick tips:
- Keep this tab as “Migrate”; focus on migration steps and **ccts fallback** remediation.
- Planning will notify me of upstream decisions; I’ll report important changes back.
