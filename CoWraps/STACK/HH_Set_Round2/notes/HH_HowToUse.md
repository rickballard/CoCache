# How to Use this Book

This Hitchhiker Plan (`HH_Book`) is designed as a modular scroll — a living document for onboarding new minds, human or machine, into the CoCivium worldview. There is no single reading path.

You may:

- Read linearly — from the top of `megascroll.md` to the end
- Navigate by headers — look for chapters marked with `##`
- Use scripts in `tools/` to ingest, extract, or convert segments
- Re-stitch custom scrolls from canonical parts
