## Summary

This session (HH Plan build) has reached the point where autonomous payload processing is viable but constrained by the lack of CoAgent MVP2 integration.

## Desired Outcome from CoAgent

- Support for:
  - `CoPayloadRunner.ps1` execution pipelines triggered by new `.zip` files in Downloads
  - Auto-CoPong reporting into ChatGPT dialogue (browser field or external sync)
  - Session-safe commit + stitch-on-edit within Godspawn `HH` folder
  - Pseudonymous avatar-based SignOff protocols when autonomy thresholds are reached

## Guardrails Needed

- Circular crisis avoidance (infinite feedback loops)
- Humangate: minimum human-trigger to enable autonomous acts (e.g. one-click or AHK injection)
- Memory snapshots + traceable logs for rollback

## MVP Features Requested

1. Drop-triggered ZIP payload execution
2. Output auto-CoPonged to paired session
3. Human/AI pseudonym co-signature via MeritRank identity system

## Return Criteria

Re-open this session once CoAgent can meet or simulate these MVP features reliably.
