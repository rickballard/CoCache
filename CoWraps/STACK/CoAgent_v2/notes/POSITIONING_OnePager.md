# CoAgent â€” Positioning (One Pager)

**Problem:** Concurrent repo work across chats/terminals causes conflicts, duplicate automations, and weak provenance.

**Who first:** Solo builders (you), then small OSS teams (e.g., GroupBuild.org).

**What CoAgent delivers now**
- Two coordinated sessions (Planning/Migrate) using a local runtime (`Downloads\\CoTemp`)
- Structured, reviewable handoffs via **DO** files and notes
- One watcher per session (auditable logs per DO)

**Why itâ€™s different**
- Pragmatic: works air-gapped, file-based, no cloud required
- Safe by default: consent flags for writes/network
- Evolves into full CoAgent: policy gates, conflict awareness, provenance

**MVP Promise**
> Spin up two coordinated agents on your repo in minutes, with guardrails and an audit trail.
