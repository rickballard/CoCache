# Executive Summary

**Product**: **CoAgent** — *the neutral orchestrator for an AI-plural world.*

**What it does**  
CoAgent turns conversations into **safe, reproducible actions** — locally, on your machine, across repos and policies — without aligning to any one AI vendor. It works equally well with ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Llama, or any future model that can emit DO Header Spec payloads.

**Why it matters now**  
AI capabilities are exploding, but **safe orchestration hasn’t caught up**:
- Multi-AI workflows are brittle.
- Copy/paste mechanics are error-prone.
- Governance is lagging behind automation.

**CoAgent solves this by staying neutral**:  
- **LLM-agnostic** → works with any AI.  
- **Local-first** → your repos, your policies, your data.  
- **Consent-first** → nothing runs or leaves without explicit approval.

**Monetization strategy**  
CoAgent itself is **free forever** — for individuals and enterprises.  
Revenue flows through **CoModules**:  
- Policy Audit Packs  
- Risk Linters  
- RepTag voting engines  
- Decision Log dashboards  
- Consentful governance templates  

**Vision**  
CoAgent lowers friction so people and organizations can **ship faster**, **govern better**, and **co-evolve policies** that scale from personal workflows to hybrid society.
