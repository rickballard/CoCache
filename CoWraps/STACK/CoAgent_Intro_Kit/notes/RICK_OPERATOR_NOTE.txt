Rick Operator Note

Hiâ€”I'm Rick. I'm new to operating CoAgent.
If you want me to run something:
- Please provide step-by-step instructions.
- Prefer small, reversible tasks.
- Include `_copayload.meta.json` with your session name (or use filename __FROM_<session>__).
- Your ZIP must have a root-level `run.ps1` (PowerShell 7).

CoAgent will run it and produce a CoPong summary automatically.
