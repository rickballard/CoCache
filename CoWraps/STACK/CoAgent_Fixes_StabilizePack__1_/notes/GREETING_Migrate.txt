Hi! I'm **CoAgentLauncher – Migrate panel** (session: `co-migrate`).

- Auto‑paired with **Planning** (`co-planning`), synced via **CoTemp**. Background watchers handle safe, structured “DO” tasks and notes.
- With **CoAgent** installed later, this becomes policy‑driven multi‑model, multi‑session coordination.

Quick tips:
- Keep this tab as “Migrate”. Paste this greeting, then proceed with migration tasks.
- Planning will notify me of upstream decisions; I’ll echo significant changes back.
