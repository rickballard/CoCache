# Privacy & IP Guard

- Treat any vendor CI/logs as potentially discoverable; keep logic in CoAgent.
- Do not echo matched line contents in CI; filenames only.
- Add repository NOTICE that BPOE logic is proprietary knowâ€‘how executed in CoAgent; CI is enforcement-only.
- Prefer private repos; limit Actions permissions; avoid external Actions where possible.
