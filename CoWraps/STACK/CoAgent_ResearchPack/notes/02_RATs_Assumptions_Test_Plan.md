# 02 â€“ Risks, Assumptions & Tests (RATs)

| Assumption | Why it matters | Evidence so far | Test we will run | Owner | Due | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Buyers need multi-model reliability | Justifies consensus cost | Anecdotes | 5 interviews with X; run task bake-off |  |  |  |
| Logs/provenance required for sign-off | Required for compliance | Reg guidelines | Show sample logs to 3 reviewers |  |  |  |
| Price tolerance at $/task | Viability | Benchmarks | Willingness-to-pay survey in interviews |  |  |  |

**Decision gates**: continue/pivot/stop criteria based on the tests above.
