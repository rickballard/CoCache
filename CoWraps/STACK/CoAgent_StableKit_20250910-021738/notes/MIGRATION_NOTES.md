# Migration Summary (auto-generated)

Date: 2025-09-10T02:17:38

## What we stabilized
- Unified `Run-DO.ps1` with engine banner and global logging
- PS5/PS7-safe `Send-DOFromClipboard.ps1` (with ctts fallback)
- Single watcher pattern with `Start/Stop-CoWatchers.ps1`
- Tag-filtered `Watch-CoTempInbox.ps1` (e.g. `-Tag 'gmig'`)
- Simple back-chatter helpers: `Send-CoNote.ps1`, `Drop-CoDO.ps1`
- Optional 2-pane launcher (prefers pwsh)

## Next suggested repo placement
- **CoCivium**: `scripts/workbench/` (launcher), `ops/workflows/bpoe/` (BPOE notes), `kits/cotemp/` (this kit)
- **CoModules**: `modules/coagent/` (product docs + roadmaps)
- Keep **CoAgent_Plans** on Desktop as local-only until ready.

## Quick PR checklist
- [ ] Add this kit under `CoCivium/kits/cotemp` and link from README
- [ ] Add a short “Getting Started” page for non-dev users
- [ ] Document the one-pane vs two-pane flows and the tag filter
- [ ] Add CI lint (PowerShell) and codespell for the kit
