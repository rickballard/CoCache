# Market Analysis

**Problem**: AI-assisted work is bottlenecked by mechanics (copy/paste DOs, repo conflicts, unsafe scripts). Enterprises need consentful automation that won’t leak.

**Alternatives**
- Raw ChatGPT pastes — brittle, unsafe
- Dev automators (scripts, RPA) — opaque, not consent-centric
- GitHub Actions — great for CI, not human-in-the-loop orchestration

**Opportunity**
- Tens of millions of knowledge workers will want “vibe coding” without risk.
- Governance workflows (policy/publishing/voting) need transparent orchestration.

**Wedge**: MVP that saves time on CoCivium, then generalize.
