# MVP Spec â€” Multi-Model Consensus

## Scope
- Adapters for N vendors (min 2)
- Router: heuristic selection by task tag
- Normalizer: JSON schema for outputs
- Aggregators: majority (structured), judge (freeform)
- Constraint checks (regex/invariants)
- Provenance logs (per-model prompts/outputs/votes)

## Non-Goals (MVP)
- Long debates > 1 round
- Training/finetuning; only light bandits later
