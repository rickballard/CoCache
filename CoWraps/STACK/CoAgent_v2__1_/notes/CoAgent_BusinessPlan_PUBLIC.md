# CoAgent — Business Plan (PUBLIC DRAFT)

**Status:** 2025-09-10T18:24:13.620377

## Problem
Concurrent repo work across chats/terminals collides; duplicate automations and weak provenance slow teams.

## Solution (MVP → beyond)
- Local CoTemp runtime with **one watcher per session**
- Structured, reviewable handoffs via **DO files** and notes
- **Consent** flags (writes/network) and auditable logs
- Roadmap to policy gates, conflict awareness, and provenance

## Users
Indie devs and small OSS teams; graduate to teams.

## Value
Faster, safer concurrent work with an audit trail.

## Next
See `docs/ROADMAP_NextSprints.md`. For private roadmap and secret sauce, use the private investor brief in `docs/private/` and encrypt it.
