# CoEvo Loop Governance Bomb (v1)

This AdviceBomb defines and scaffolds a CoEvolution Loop (CoEvoLoop) governance framework for use within CoSuite. It includes protocols for:

- Managing AI-human iterative deliverable evolution
- Preventing runaway productivity, divergence, or unsustainable forking
- Maintaining transparency, congruence, and pacing via BPOE
- Anchoring all loops in trustable audit trails and convergence pathways

See `LOOP_GUIDE.md` for concept-level governance, and `GOVERNANCE_PLAN.md` for implementation guidance.
