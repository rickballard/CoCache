# PLAN_BACKLOG (Living)

## Backlog Items
- Identity validators for receipts (pre-commit or CI)
- AdviceBomb unpack + tagger (topics, license, intent)
- Feed-based drift/heartbeats (per repo, per area)
- CoAgent pre-auth / repo discovery strategy (design doc)
- BPOE link-hardening rules & link-check CI (absolute URLs)

## Open Questions
- CoSteward vs Steward roles split: scope & UI differences?
- Where should 3P assets be vendored vs referenced?
- Standard “session id” convention across all receipts?

## Decisions (log)
- Heavy housekeeping in CI, not locally
- PR-only on protected branches
