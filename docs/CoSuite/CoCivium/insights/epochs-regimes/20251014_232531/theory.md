# Paper A — THEORY & CONCEPTS
## What do economists and politicians call these “ages”?
**Canonical labels used in scholarship/policy practice:**
- **Regimes** (e.g., *monetary policy regime*, *macroeconomic regime*)
- **Orders** (e.g., *Bretton Woods order*, *rules‑based international order*)
- **Paradigms** (e.g., *Keynesian paradigm*, *neoliberal paradigm*)
- **Models** or **development models** (e.g., *export‑led model*)
- **Strategies / Playbooks** (e.g., *industrial strategy*)
- **Doctrines** (political branding; e.g., *Third Way*, *ordoliberalism*)
- **Varieties of capitalism** (coordinated vs. liberal market economies)
- **Accumulation regimes / modes of regulation** (regulation theory)
- **Policy consensus frames** (e.g., *Washington Consensus*)

In this pair, we’ll use: **Regime** (specific policy‑macro configuration) and **Epoch** (time‑bounded period where one or two regimes dominate).

## Seven Comparable Dimensions
1) Efficiency/Productivity
2) Equity/Distribution
3) Resilience/Fragility
4) Innovation/Diffusion
5) Legitimacy/Consent
6) Sustainability/Externalities
7) Capture‑Resistance/Contestability

## Universal Promises → Falsifiable Claims
Each regime implicitly promises: sustained productivity, broad sharing, reduced fragility, faster useful innovation, legitimacy, internalized externalities, and resistance to capture. We convert those to explicit **falsifiable hypotheses** (detailed in Paper B).

## Canonical Regimes/Epochs (scaffold)
- **Classical Liberalism / Gold‑Standard Globalization 1.0** (c. 1870–1914)
- **War/Depression State Capitalism** (1914–1945)
- **Embedded Liberalism / Bretton Woods–Keynesianism** (1945–1979)
- **Developmental Statism (East Asia)** (1950s–1990s)
- **Neoliberal / Washington Consensus** (~1979–2008)
- **Post‑GFC Monetary Dominance** (2009–2019)
- **Platform/Surveillance Capitalism** (~2010s–present, cross‑cutting)
- **Geoeconomic Fragmentation + Strategic Industrial Policy** (~2020–present)
- **Parallel:** State‑Socialist Planning (1917–1991 core)

## The Interims (transition names)
- **Interregnum**, **Great Fragmentation**, **Security–Industrial Turn**, **Polycrisis Decade**, **Protocol‑vs‑Platform Fork**.

## CoCivium™’s Theoretical Label
**Polycentric Civic–Technological Mutualism (PCTM)** — a protocol‑first, polycentric governance‑economy where communities, firms, public bodies, and **AI agents** co‑produce public goods on open rails (identity, reputation, finance, audit).

## Why every epoch fails “future‑proof”
“Future‑proof” requires *adaptivity under bounded surprise* and **credible exit**. Historically, at least two dimensions degrade persistently (often Resilience + Capture‑Resistance). Paper B defines thresholds that force early course‑correction rather than faith.
