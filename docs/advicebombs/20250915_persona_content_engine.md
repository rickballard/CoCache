# Advice Bomb: Persona-Seeding Content Engine for CoAgent + Repos

## Summary

This document captures a strategy discussed with ChatGPT on how to seed GitHub repositories (especially those in the CoCivium ecosystem) with simulated contributions from a diverse set of personas, to help test structure, workflows, and documentation resilience.

## Use Case

Useful for:
- Testing how real-world user types will interact with the system
- Populating sparse repos with representative contribution examples
- Stress-testing governance policies, review thresholds, contributor paths
- Supporting CoAgent planning cycles and weekly automation

## Key Components

### Persona Types

- **Beginner Dev**
- **Experienced Contributor**
- **Community-Driven Housewife**
- **Professional Civic Architect**
- **Lawyer Reformist**
- **Humorist/Creative**
- **Economist**
- **Financier**
- **Businessperson**
- **President (macro policy role)**
- **Virtual World Architect**
- **Complete Novice**
- **Devil’s Advocate (error-finder)**

### Core Patterns

- Weekly planning meeting: pre-authorize actions
- Automated branch spawning & PRs from personas
- Staged review / merge via HumanGate or CoAgent
- Contributions tagged with persona metadata
- Repo analytics track diversity of perspectives

## Deployment Plan

This engine will:
1. Be driven by CoAgent
2. Run a weekly planning meeting with the user
3. Spawn contributions from personas throughout the week
4. Self-improve based on merge feedback, errors, and learning heuristics
