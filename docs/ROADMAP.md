# Roadmap (v0)

## NOW (execute without review under Preauth)
- Finish **missing-only** sweep(s) until 0 files remain.
- Run **link sweep**: fix intra-repo relatives; collect external 404s; open issues for leftovers.
- **CI noise**: make PR labeler single-source-of-truth; quarantine yamllint or tune rules so itâ€™s non-blocking.
- Create PROJECTS.md index from projects/* READMEs.

## NEXT (still Preauth unless noted)
- **Brand pack**: keep in repo; wire into README only (no Pages yet).  
- **CoIndex**: nightly/cronable script in CoCache; read-only publish into CoCivium.  
- **Issue import**: recreate open CoCivium issues with backlinks.  
- Prepare **GH Pages** scaffolding (no enable) + favicons (DIV-011).

## LATER (needs your review)
- Pages launch + favicon/apple-touch integration.  
- Trademark search & registration path for logo.  
- Governance doc (stewardship, CLA/not-CLA stance).
