# BPOE â€” Best Possible Operational Experience

- **Timestamped local drops**: name as Name_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.ext to avoid Windows (1) collisions.
- **Repo-first**: prefer committing scripts/content to repos; use Downloads only as a launchpad.
- **Idempotent scripts**: safe re-runs; no assuming working directory; verbose success/failure.
- **Handoffs**: every session ends with a docs/HANDOFFS/HANDOFF_*.md.
