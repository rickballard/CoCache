# ­ЪњБ AdviceBomb Рђћ [2025-09-15] Рђћ Thread Integration and Repo Wisdom Flow

## ­ЪДа Key Insight
To preserve session wisdom and ensure it flows into durable infrastructure, plant AdviceBombs in CoCache, not individual repos.

## ­Ъњг Context
Prompt: "Where should we plant the advice bomb so the wisdom in this thread gets integrated?"

## ­ЪДЕ Relevance
This insight applies broadly:
- CoCache/docs/wisdom/ is the best root folder.
- CoModules and Civium should link here from README or doc/footer.
- RickPad and RickPublic can reference these entries.

## Рџа№ИЈ Potential Risks If Ignored
- Session wisdom rots in transcripts and dies with bloat.
- Useful insights go un-actioned or forgotten.
- No source-of-truth for BPOE learnings across modules.

## РюЁ Recommended Action
- Link dvicebombs/ index in README.md of CoCache.
- Auto-index and version these bombs.
- Create a markdown schema or tag-based catalog.
