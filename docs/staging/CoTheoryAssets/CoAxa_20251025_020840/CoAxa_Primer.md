# CoAxa Primer: Governance, Law, Rights and Regulation

CoAxa is the domain of **coercion governance**: how authority is legitimated, constrained, distributed, audited, evolved and deprecated. It addresses how laws are formed, enforced, resisted, or revised. It includes the machinery of state, transnational governance, AI adjudication, and decentralized legal systems.

Key Responsibilities:
- Representation and Legitimacy
- Rule of Law (interpretation, application, exceptions)
- Adjudication and Dispute Resolution
- Enforcement and Policing
- Rights and Freedoms (e.g., mobility, speech, access)
- Anti-coercion and corruption resistance
- Regulatory layering (local, regional, global, AI)
