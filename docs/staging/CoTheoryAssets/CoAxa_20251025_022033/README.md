# CoAxa AdviceBomb â€“ 2025-10-25

This folder contains the CoAxa node of the CoTheory architecture, focused on **foundational assumptions, axioms, and base truths** that underpin all CoCivium logic systems.

## Components

- ðŸ“‹ CoAxa_Checklist.md: Status-tracked task list for AdviceBomb assembly.
- ðŸ“„ CoAxa_Primer.md: High-level primer to explain CoAxa's function and relevance.
- ðŸ“‚ CoAxa_Subdomain_Scaffolds/: Subfolders and scaffold .md files per knowledge domain.

## Use

CoAxa serves as the **philosophical layer** behind all other CoTheory nodes. Each assumption tracked here may affect multiple downstream models. CoAxa should be updated **only with traceable, context-rich logic**.

This package is intended for handoff to the Prime/Lead session via the CoCache repo.
