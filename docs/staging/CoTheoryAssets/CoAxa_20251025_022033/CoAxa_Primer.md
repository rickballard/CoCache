# CoAxa Primer

CoAxa is the “axioms and assumptions” layer of CoTheory. It records, tests, refines, and categorizes foundational beliefs, logics, and truth claims used across the CoCivium ecosystem.

This folder acts as the philosophical and meta-epistemological scaffolding behind models in CoCore. Subdomains (see CoAxa_Subdomain_Scaffolds/) group these assumptions by foundational domain (e.g., physics, logic, value theory).

Future CoTheory growth depends on CoAxa’s ability to track which assumptions are stable, which are evolving, and which are contestable.
