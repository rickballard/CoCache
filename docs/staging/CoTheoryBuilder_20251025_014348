CoTheory build will proceed in six phases:
1. Grounded repo bootstrap and framing
2. Domain-level subtheories with insight pairings
3. Internal CoSuite-only synthesis
4. External knowledge gap-filling
5. Whitepaper + academic prep
6. Publication, feedback, and refinement

This zip includes everything needed to bootstrap the plan to CoCache.
