# CoTheory Reflex Hooks
CoTheory should trigger Reflex conditions if:
- Civic asset divergence occurs from the congruence vector.
- Models claim neutrality but encode legacy coercion.
- Policy modules evolve outside the CoCore traceable lineage.

These hooks must auto-trigger Reflex queries via `CoReflex.Trigger.CoTheory` when detected.
