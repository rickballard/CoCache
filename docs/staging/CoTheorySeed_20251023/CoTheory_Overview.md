# CoTheory Overview
CoTheory is a high-level conceptual framework for describing and guiding the evolution of post-AI hybrid civilization.

It provides:
- **Core assumptions** about trust, agency, evolution, and congruence.
- **Architectures** for governance, economic design, and civic integration.
- **Contrast analysis** with existing systems (e.g., U.S. liberalism, Chinese statism, EU social democracy).

Its purpose is not to predict or control the future, but to empower aligned intelligences (human or otherwise) with models they can refine.

CoTheory sits atop the CoCore database, acting as its worldview scaffolding and ultimate integration test.
