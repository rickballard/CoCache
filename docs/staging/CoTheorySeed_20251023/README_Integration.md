# CoTheory Integration Notes
This payload bridges CoTheory to:
- `CoCore`: via model references and worldview dependency.
- `GIBindex`: via seed tags.
- `CoReflex`: via evolutionary hooks to prevent incoherent drift.

All other payloads in this seed package assume this structural mapping is in place.
