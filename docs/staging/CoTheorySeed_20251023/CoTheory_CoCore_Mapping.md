# CoTheory ↔ CoCore Mapping
CoTheory is positioned as the worldview stratum that integrates all CoCore models.

**Mapping Examples:**
- Menzies Economic Model → CoTheory assumes post-scarcity asymptotes & disintermediated exchange.
- FinFlow System → Aligned value-exchange visibility, trust ledgers, flow-based financial ontologies.
- Open Civic Stack → Reflex-triggered governance, civic algorithms, incentive balancing.

Future mappings should include diagnostics for alignment/coherence gaps.
