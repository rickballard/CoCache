# CoTheory Submission Kit

This folder contains the fully staged abstraction and submission plan for CoTheory. It is designed for:
- Internal CoCivium comprehension and handover
- Future external academic submission once CoTheory reaches full maturity
- Reflex or CoAgent-triggered staging pipelines

See `CoTheory_Layers.md` for abstraction breakdown.
See `JOURNAL_LAUNCH_PLAN.md` for peer-review targets and strategy.
