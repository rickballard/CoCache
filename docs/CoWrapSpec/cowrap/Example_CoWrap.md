# CoWrap: Session â€“ CoWrap vs Advice Bomb Finalization

**Session Context**: Defined distinction between CoWraps and Advice Bombs.  
**Outcome**: Finalized semantics, packaging spec, and repo strategy.

## Key Inferences

- CoWraps are semantically passive until parsed by a future mind.
- Advice Bombs carry executable intent and must be sandboxed.
- CoWraps are better stored in `CoRef/cowrap/`, not a new repo (yet).
- Future: CoAgent should include CoWrap as real-time background behavior for all sessions.
