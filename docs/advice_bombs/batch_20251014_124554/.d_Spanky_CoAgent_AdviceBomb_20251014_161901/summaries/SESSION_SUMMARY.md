# Session Synthesis — CoAgent Advice Bomb (Executive Summary)

**Purpose:** Provide a concise, portable synthesis of this session’s insights so other sessions can execute without re-reading long chats.

## Essence
- Build CoAgent to minimize LLM session bloat by externalizing memory and assembling context **just-in-time (JIT)** from a structured **CoMemory Offload**.
- Establish **Gibberlink (GLX)** as a compact semantic layer, versioned in **GIBINDEX**, to stabilize meaning and compress artifacts.
- Prefer **standards-first interop** (MCP-style) and **CLI-first** control of external tools; add APIs later when workflows stabilize.
- Support **zero-footprint trial** and **permanent** modes; bias routing to **max-power models** with policy-based fallbacks.
- Protect creators with a **provenance graph** and a **gentle upgrade** flow (propose → preview → accept) plus restore options.
- Add robust **metrics, safety preflights, QA/red-team suites, accessibility, compliance**, and **community feedback** tuned for evolution, not repetition.

## Key Directions
1. **Memory & Context:** Content-addressed store, hybrid indices (vectors + keywords + GLX + recency), hierarchical summarization, JIT assembly with hard token budgets.
2. **GLX Integration:** Versioned symbols; human↔GLX transpilation; retrieval using GLX first; governance in GIBINDEX.
3. **Interoperability:** MCP-style connectors; CLI-first; later APIs for mature flows.
4. **Operating Modes:** Zero-footprint ephemeral default; easy graduation to permanent; explicit export; auto-purge.
5. **Max-Power Routing:** Always use the strongest available model/tools within budgets; log fallbacks; enable browsing when freshness matters.
6. **Creator Provenance:** Canonality scale; essence notes; restore keys; attribution; deprecation without erasure.
7. **Security/Compliance:** Data minimization; local-first; encrypted vaults; compliance packs; safety preflight scans.
8. **Observability & QA:** CFR, Recall@K, DupRatio, SummaryLoss; golden-sets; adversarial suites; chaos drills; SLOs.
9. **Community & Adoption:** Stage-aware feedback; duplicate clustering; non-monetary recognition; zero-friction trial; RFC process.
10. **Scaling & Sustainability:** Cost-aware routing; latency envelopes; caching; energy telemetry; batch windows.

## Priority Recommendations (near-term)
- Stand up **CoMemory Offload MVP** and **JIT context assembler** with hierarchical summarizer.
- Ship **GLX v0.1** spec + validator, wired into retrieval.
- Enforce **propose→preview→accept** for creator-heavy edits; surface provenance graph.
- Implement **Max-Power router** with budget caps and telemetry.
- Add **Safety Preflight** + minimal **metrics dashboard**.
- Prepare **P0 epics** for interoperability (MCP servers), feedback clustering, and accessibility for diff/restore.

## Success Indicators
- 95% of tasks complete without re-inlining >2k tokens of history.
- Recall@K ≥ 0.8 on golden sets; SummaryLoss < 2%; median CFR ≤ 0.6.
- Essence Preservation ≥ 4/5; Regret Rate ≤ 5% at 14 days.
