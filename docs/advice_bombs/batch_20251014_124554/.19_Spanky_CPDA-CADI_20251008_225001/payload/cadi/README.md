# CADI — CoCivium™ Asteroid Defence Initiative

**Mission:** Plan and publish open, reproducible models for asteroid threat assessment and mitigation, under neutral, anti-capture governance.

## Headline framing — the Quadrant
See `docs/assets/quad.svg` and `docs/index.md` for annotated graphic.

## Ship List
- `/specs` — threat models, mitigation options, trigger thresholds
- `/models` — ΔV tables; uncertainty handling; deflection/disruption model notes
- `/scenarios` — PDC-style exercises; decision trees; comms templates
- `/datasets` — schemas & pointers (use open data licenses)

## Governance (no kings)
**Circles** run workstreams; **Stewards** execute time-bound **Mandates**; DAO/mesh rules inherited from CPDA.
