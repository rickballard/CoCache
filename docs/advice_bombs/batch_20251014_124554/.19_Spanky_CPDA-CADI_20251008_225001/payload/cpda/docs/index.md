# CPDA — a commons umbrella (becoming **CoCivium™**)
We begin by showcasing **CADI** — an open effort to model and prepare asteroid-defence strategies under neutral, anti-capture governance.

- **Why now:** Warning windows range from hours to decades; meaningful deflection requires **years** of preparation.
- **How we work:** No kings. Rotating **Stewards**, open **Contributors**, **Circles** with time-bound **Mandates**; legal shells provide compliance scaffolding.

## Portfolio (Seed → Future)
- **CADI** — CoCivium™ Asteroid Defence Initiative (live showcase)
- **CoPolitic** — Policy/standards commons (coming)
- **CoFinance/FinFlow** — Open finance models (coming)
- **CoRef/CoCore** — Best-practice DB & references (coming)
