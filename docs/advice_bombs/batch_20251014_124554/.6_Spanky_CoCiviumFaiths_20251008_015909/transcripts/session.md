# Session Transcript (Reconstructed Summary)

**Window:** to 2025-10-08 01:59:09 local  
**Focus:** CoCivium — Faiths in Dialogue; CoRef indexing; Congruence Doctrine; CoRender + CI fallbacks; Godspawn Part 3 advice; main-landing audits; CoWrap.

## Major Phases
1. **Faiths in Dialogue** — seeded/expanded Christianity deep-dive; created crosswalk, cases, red team, and policy patterns; added hero placeholder and manifest; generated CoRef sidecars.
2. **Congruence Doctrine** — established doctrine index with CoRef sidecar and generator.
3. **Indexing (CoRef)** — concept-first sidecar scheme; HH alignment; exemplar entries; tools for sidecar regen.
4. **Graphics & CI** — CoRender fallback pipeline; non-blocking pre-commit; CI render workflow; local Inkscape optional.
5. **Godspawn P3** — advice bomb added: outline-to-doctrine crosswalk and outline for Part 3.
6. **Landing-on-main hygiene** — audit + land-from-plan scripts; verified no off-main deltas; pushed Godspawn/main fast-forward; pruned merged topic branches (optional).
7. **CoWrap** — session close note under `insights/Reports/CoWrap/2025-10-07.md` in CoCivium.

## Notable Branches Touched (remote namespaces abbreviated)
- CoCivium: `feature/faiths-dialogue-v0.2.0`, `v0.2.1`, `v0.3.1`; `feature/faiths-hero-v0.1.0`; `feature/coref-indexing-setup`; `chore/cowrap-20251006_225430`.
- Godspawn: `feature/coref-indexing-setup`, `feature/godspawn-p3-advice-v0.1.0`, `chore/remove-stubs-20251006_210011`.
- CoAgent: `feature/corender-ci-fallbacks` and supporting topic branches.

## Outcomes
- **Artifacts present in repos** (public): Faiths-in-Dialogue docs + sidecars; Doctrine index; hero SVG placeholder; CoRender CI + hooks; Godspawn P3 advice pack; CoWrap note.
- **Main status:** Post-audit, no actionable ahead-of-main topic branches. Godspawn main updated. CI renders delegated when Inkscape missing.
- **Policy:** Steward BPOE preference to land seeding work directly on main captured in `notes/BPOE.md` (this pack).

## Pivots / Corrections
- Moved from blocking pre-commit to **non-blocking** with CI renders.
- Introduced two-stage **audit → land** workflow to avoid de-evolving main.
- Replaced linear anchors with **CoRef sidecars** and **edit-robust anchors**.

## Follow-ups
- Optional: enforce steward merge policy (protected bypass for seeders) and periodic branch pruning via CI.
