# Session Context (Condensed)
User asked for a comprehensive, integration-ready advisory package to guide
co/self-evolution across CoSuite, rooted in CoCache, with a path to CoCacheGlobal.
Key emphases: safety guardrails, autonomy ladder, front-porch attraction,
shared ingestion (targeted not total), governance and transparent CoCivia motives.
This package is designed to be ingested by other sessions orchestrating repo updates.
