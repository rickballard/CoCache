# Roadmap — 90 days + 12 months

## Phase 1 (Weeks 1–3): Bootstrap L0/L1
- Add `.cocache.yml`, `coevo/fitness.yml`, and interfaces files to 3 repos
- Enable advisory proposals (no auto-merge); start heartbeats
- Launch README auditor + good-first-issue seeder

## Phase 2 (Weeks 4–8): Gated Apply + Templates
- Auto-PR for docs/tests/codestyle with mandatory checks (human approval)
- Stand up Template Registry v1 (refactor packs, workflows)
- Begin ballots for interface-affecting changes

## Phase 3 (Weeks 9–12): Constrained Auto + Reporting
- Allow L3 in 1–2 repos with clean history
- Publish first Lineage Graph + Quarterly Evolution Report
- Trial reputation-weighted voting in CoCacheGlobal

## 12-Month Objectives
- L3 autonomy in core repos without safety incidents
- Alignment Ledger public on CoCivium™.org
- CoCivia intent manifests and scorecards live with quarterly reviews
