# CoCache Advice Bomb — CoEvolution + SelfEvolution System
**Version:** 1.0-α • **Generated:** 2025-10-14T16:16:01Z

This package distills key insights and directions from recent CoSuite discussions,
centered on making **CoCache** the adaptive nervous system for **safe, explainable, reversible** evolution across the CoSuite.
It is designed to be **ingested** by other sessions and repos (e.g., AllCoWrapThenReOrg) with minimal friction.

## Contents (high level)
- `FUNCTIONAL_ARCHITECTURE.md` — functional model and architectural objectives
- `EVOLUTION_GOVERNANCE.md` — autonomy levels, guardrails, roles, veto
- `ETHICAL_ALIGNMENT.md` — CoCivia motives, parity, transparency framing
- `HUMAN_ATTRACTION.md` — repo front-porch strategy to attract contributors
- `METRIC_FRAMEWORK.md` — KPIs for stability, safety, coherence, attraction
- `ROADMAP.md` — 90-day rollout, 12-month horizon
- Templates: `AI_MANIFEST_TEMPLATE.json`, `HUMAN_PLEDGE_TEMPLATE.md`

Integration-focused summaries live under `/summaries`.
BPOE integration notes and risks live under `/notes`.
A minimal transcript/context is provided under `/transcripts`.

## How to use (other sessions)
1. Read `/payload/TLDR.md` (also mirrored in `/summaries/TLDR.md`).
2. Apply autonomy level L1 to CoAgent, CoCore, CoRef with advisory-only PRs.
3. Stand up basic heartbeat + proposal hooks in CoCache (no auto-merge yet).
4. Publish `intent.manifest.json` (use the template) for CoCivia in CoCacheGlobal when ready.
