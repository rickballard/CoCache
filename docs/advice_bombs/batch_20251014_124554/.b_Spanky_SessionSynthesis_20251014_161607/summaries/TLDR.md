# TL;DR — CoSuite Session Synthesis (Executive Read)

- **Objective now:** unify active streams (CoAgent, CoCache, CoCore, CoRef, CoCivium) under one operational alignment layer so work can proceed in parallel without drift.
- **Near-term deliverables:** a reusable *Deep Analysis + Advice Bomb* prompt, repo‑specific impacts, and a clear handoff checklist for implementation sessions.
- **Guardrails:** congruence first (non‑coercive, auditable), transparency by default, and autonomy with safety (avoid triggering external safety flags).
- **Measure what matters:** coherence across repos, payload traceability, and adoption of shared playbooks.
- **What to do next:** drop this package into CoCache → propagate summaries to CoAgent/CoCore/CoRef/CoCivium → run the alignment checklist.
