# CoSuite Session — Main Insights & Directions

## Core Insights
1) **Alignment Over Fragmentation.** Multiple sessions are producing valuable planning artifacts; without a unifying layer these create coordination drag. Align intent, vocabulary, and handoff formats.
2) **Advice Bombs as Interfaces.** Treat advice bombs as stable, machine‑and‑human readable interfaces between sessions and repos (with consistent manifests, checksums, and provenance).
3) **Congruence as North Star.** Decisions should reinforce a non‑coercive, transparent hybrid society model. Bake this into scoring and governance docs.
4) **Productization Pressure.** CoAgent MVP2/3 needs sharper positioning versus external “Agent/Workflow” offerings while remaining collaboration‑ready, not adversarial.
5) **Operational Traceability.** Every payload should be auditable: where it came from, which session created it, and which repo consumed it.

## Strategic Directions
- **Single Alignment Layer:** codify a minimal, shared standard for manifests, intent files, and status lines; ensure all advice bombs follow it.
- **Evidence‑First:** move assertions from prose into structured references via CoRef; track source fidelity and trust chains.
- **Safety Protocol:** establish preflight checks that avoid triggering model safety flags and external policy alarms during autonomy experiments.
- **Repo Convergence:** define responsibilities and handoffs explicitly (see “Repo Impacts”).

## Practical Effects
- Faster ingest into CoCache with fewer mismatches.
- Predictable CoAgent productization path and vendor‑friendly outreach narrative.
- Lower friction for future automation and cross‑session reuse.
