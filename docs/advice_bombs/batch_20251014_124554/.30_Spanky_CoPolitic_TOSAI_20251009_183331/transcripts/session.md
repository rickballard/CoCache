# Session Transcript (Concise Reconstruction)
**Theme:** CoPolitic → rename CoCEO to **TOS-AI (Transition Office Steward – AI pivots)**; wire homepage explainer, checklist, CTA; roles page; logo pipeline; CoWrap bundles (v2/v3/v3.1).

**Key Steps:**
- Replaced all CoCEO variants → `TOS-AI` across repo content; added first-mention expansion.
- Added `docs/defs/TOS-AI.md`, `docs/defs/CoCEO.md` deprecation stub, and `docs/GLOSSARY.md`.
- Homepage: inserted TOS-AI explainer chip, checklist card, and CTA linking to prefilled GitHub issue; legacy `/coceo.html` redirect.
- Added `/roles/tos-ai.html` and footer “Roles” link; made a minimal `/roles/index.html` (MeritRank PR-only note).
- Logos: normalized OpenAI + Skoll; added client-side initials-badge fallback for missing logos; built scripts for logo audit & normalization.
- CoWrap bundles produced (v2, v3, v3.1) into CoCache; included action deck, manifest JSON, scripts.
- Cache sanity checks used `Age/ETag/X-Served-By` via `Invoke-WebRequest` with `nocache` GUID.

**Pivots/Notes:**
- Role name pivoted from CoCEO → TOS-AI to avoid authority conflict and emphasize time-boxed stewardship.
- Logos hunt automated partially; local scans sometimes returned zero due to environment/permissions/empty folders.
- MeritRank main branch protected → PR required (push rejected), captured for future sessions.

**Outstanding:**
- Fill remaining exemplar logos and normalize to 160×160 transparent PNG (dark-on-white).
- Add `/roles/index.html` hub in CoPolitic (optional).
- Optional one-pager PDF autobuild and link-checker action.
