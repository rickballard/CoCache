# Session Transcript (Concise Capture)

**When:** 2025-10-09T16:24:06.181757 (America/Toronto assumed)  
**Focus:** Automating RickPublic ↔ CoCivium™ weekly messaging; baseline + between-article experimentation; packaging outputs for repo handoff.

## Actions
- Authored Idea Card (baseline spec, pipeline, metrics, safety gates, speaking pipeline).
- Built a PS7 automation pack (zip) with `Run-RickPublicSetup.ps1` and content templates.
- Prepared this Spanky package with transcripts, payloads, notes, summaries, checksums, and manifests per spec.

## Notes on Attachments
- Included: `/mnt/data/Spanky_Request_Pack_v2_2_2025-10-08.zip` .

## Constraints
- No background execution; everything produced as downloadable artifacts.
- Experiments measured only **between** separate articles; baseline frozen for first four issues.
