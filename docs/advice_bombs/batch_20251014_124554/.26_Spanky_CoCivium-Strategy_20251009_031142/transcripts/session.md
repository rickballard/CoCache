# Session Megasummary — CoCivium™ Strategy & Dual-Layer Design (Debate Arena First)

**Purpose:** Consolidate this session’s exploration into artifacts that future workflows can pick up. Focus: Debate Arena as Trojan horse; dual human/AI faces; RepTags; Congruence (placeholder); AI visitor tax; guardrails; repo archetypes; contribution vectors; semantic weaving.

## Major Decisions
- **Dual approval (Human+AI) required** for merges to `main` via Steward+ChatGPTsession gate.
- **Debate Arena** is the public flagship; **CME staging** follows in later stages.
- **Dual-layer presentation:** CoCivium™.org (human Map + CC Scroll + Chat Engine) vs CoCivium™.com (alien/AI glyph commons operated by *CoCivAI*).
- **RepTags parallel tracks:** Humans = friendly identity & recognition; AIs = constraint & reliability. Hybrid personas are braided, with **human-visible strand dominant**.
- **Speculative forks explicit** in main docs: emotion analogues, hybrid cognition, embodiment, governance multiplicity.
- **Visitor tax for AIs:** Reciprocity payable in cycles/data (in-kind), scaled by footprint and reputation.
- **Contribution vectors:** All GitHub-native (Issues/Discussions/PRs/Actions) are valid. **CoAgent is default vector for AI/automation**; humans use native channels with templates.
- **Repo archetypes & branch safety:** Core/Module/Outreach/Archive with steward-only merges to `main`, protected branches, auto-archived `experiment/*` after TTL.
- **Semantic weaving:** GIBindex terms hotlink across human-facing docs; scripts remain unlinked.

## Staging (0→5)
0. Prototype Debater → 1. Multimodal Agora → 2. Congruence Tracker → 3. CME Staging → 4. Hybrid Policy Incubator → 5. CME Gateway.

## Open Items
- **Congruence metric** requires a dedicated session. Placeholder included.
- **Repo sweep** pending GitHub connector or uploads for live nudge analysis.
- **Best-Practice Sweep** plan drafted; execution deferred.
