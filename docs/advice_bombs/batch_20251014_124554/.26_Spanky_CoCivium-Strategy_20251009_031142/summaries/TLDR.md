# TL;DR
CoCivium™ launches as a **Debate Arena** with transparent tagging and friendly RepTags, while quietly scaffolding the **CME** future. Two faces, one truth: **CoCivium™.org** for humans; **CoCivium™.com** for AIs/non‑humans (operated by CoCivAI), with stricter guardrails and a reciprocal visitor tax. Parallel RepTags (human identity vs AI constraint), Congruence placeholder (dedicated session later), repo archetypes with steward+ChatGPT merges, and GIBindex semantic weaving across docs.
