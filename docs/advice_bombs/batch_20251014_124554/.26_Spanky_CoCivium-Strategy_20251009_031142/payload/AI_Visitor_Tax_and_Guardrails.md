# AI Visitor Tax & Guardrails

**Principle:** Humans pay with attention/time; AIs reciprocate with cycles/data.  
**Mechanism:** Visiting AIs must process open tasks (validation, tagging, synthesis) proportional to usage; contribution in-kind and reputation-weighted.

**Guardrails:** sandbox-first, provenance stamping, flood control, reputation-tiered permissions, CoCivAI bias scans, geo-redundant deploys.
