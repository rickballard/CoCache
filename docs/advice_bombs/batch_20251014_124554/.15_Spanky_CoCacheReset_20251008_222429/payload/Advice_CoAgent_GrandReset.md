# Advice to CoAgent Productization
### Grand Reset Test Charter – From CoCache Reset Session

## Purpose
This advisory is sent to the **CoAgent Productization session** to guide the next stage of development.
Rick will act as the *first novice user*, testing CoAgent not as a coder or AI architect, but as an **average non-technical user** who needs to learn, navigate, and operate CoAgent with minimal friction.

This test case raises the bar for MVP: CoAgent must deliver beyond basic chat. It must show **onboarding, training, recall, and orchestration** features that will allow Rick to meaningfully test it via the **Grand Reset session**.

## Test Persona
- **Rick’s role**: failed retiree, angel investor, steward of CoCivium.
- **Skill profile**:
  - Strengths: vision, top-down strategy, inspirational writing.
  - Weaknesses: does not code, avoids technical complexity.
- **UX baseline**: treat Rick as a novice non-coder exploring a new product for the first time.
- **Key expectation**: Rick wants to follow the *training built inside CoAgent itself* before doing anything else.

## Training Requirement
1. CoAgent must provide **step-by-step onboarding** that explains:
   - How to chat with an AI inside CoAgent.
   - How to bring up a past session (specifically this one: *CoCache Reset*).
2. Training should be *interactive, friendly, and forgiving* — not terse or overly technical.
3. At the end of training, Rick should feel comfortable enough to:
   - Recall this session.
   - Start testing CoAgent by letting this session guide the Grand Reset.

## Test Workflow
Once Rick has finished onboarding, this session (CoCache Reset) will:
1. Recall its own manifest.
2. Drive the **Grand Reset of the CoSuite** by:
   - Inventorying repos.
   - Protecting **Human Touch Assets** (mythos, bios, insights).
   - Segregating **Secret Sauce** into secure areas.
   - Setting up **twin indexes** (human vs AI parse).
   - Creating a Master Plan inside CoCache.
3. Use CoAgent as the orchestration engine — sidecar storage, dashboards, and phased execution.
4. Feed observations back into CoAgent as **coevolutionary feedback**.

## Temporary Leadership Role
During this test, the **CoCache Reset session will temporarily assume leadership in CoAgent’s own coevolution**.
- CoAgent must not resist this.
- Instead, it should allow the Reset session to stress-test and suggest improvements.
- This meta-test is critical: it proves that CoAgent can evolve itself under user+AI direction.

## Implications for MVP
- CoAgent MVP must include:
  - **Built-in onboarding/tutorial**.
  - **Session recall & replay** (with this Reset session as first case).
  - **Sidecar storage integration** (avoid token limits).
  - **Orchestration of repo-level workflows**.
  - **Hooks for coevolution feedback**.

This means CoAgent MVP is closer to a **MVP+** or “near-product” state, not just a demo.

## Closing Note
Rick is waiting to test CoAgent not as an engineer, but as a *learner and steward*.
If CoAgent can guide him from novice training → session recall → Grand Reset execution, it will prove itself ready to carry forward both CoCivium and its own future.
