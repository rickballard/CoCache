# TL;DR
Delivered a geometry-consistent CoAgent branding system (head, cone torso, 3 halos) with dual light/dark exports, minimal favicons, optional bolt for active states, and a packaged set ready for productization. CoCiviumâ„¢ remains grayscale master brand; CoAgent uses monochrome by default with rainbow reserved for docs/splash.
