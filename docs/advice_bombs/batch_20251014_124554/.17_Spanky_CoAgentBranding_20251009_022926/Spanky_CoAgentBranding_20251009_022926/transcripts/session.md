# Session Transcript (Concise Reconstruction)

**Session:** CoAgent Branding Package  
**Date:** 2025-10-09T02:29:26

## Overview
- Designed geometry-first identity: circular head + straight-sided cone torso (~30°) + **three nested halos** (C-shapes).
- Produced assets for **light** (black/gray on transparent) and **dark** (white on transparent) backgrounds.
- Created **paired wide mark** with optional **lightning bolt** used as *status/active transmission* indicator.
- Delivered **favicons (16/32/64)** using minimal head+arcs for small-scale clarity.
- Packaged **CoCivium™ grayscale references** and defined **brand hierarchy**: CoCivium™ (master grayscale) → CoAgent (rainbow-capable child) → CoModules (family geometry with accents).

## Key Decisions
- Two export sets (light/dark).  
- Rainbow reserved for splash/docs; monochrome for app UI & trays.  
- Bolt animation only in active/handshake contexts; omit in static branding and small icons.

## Generated Assets
- See `/payload/branding/`.
