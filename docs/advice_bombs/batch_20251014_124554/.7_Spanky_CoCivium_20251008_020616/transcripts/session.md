# Session Transcript (Condensed)

This transcript summarizes the packaging workflow for **CoCivium/CoCache** using ZIP cycles and `do.ps1` launchers from Downloads, auto-version selection, and cleanup.

## Early intentions
- Batch work per cycle with **single-run DO blocks** from Downloads.
- Auto-pick highest version per package base and **delete older/used zips**.
- Keep **Being Noname** canonical exact and synced.
- Seed **principles, BPOE human-limits**, and **CC megascroll** scaffolding.
- Add **PR/Issue templates** and **line-ending policy**.
- Provide a **CoWrap** session wrap.

## Pivots & inferences
- Standardized on **zip + manifest.json + do.ps1**.
- Introduced **Downloads runner** to discover/run latest per base, then clean.
- Hardened semver parsing to tolerate trailing dots/prereleases.

## Highlights
- Seed packages (Principles/BPOE/CC, templates, hook) pushed to `main`.
- Recovery sweep imported many `Recovery/*` files.
- AIO added safety workflow + scripts, BN guard; CC inline script iterated.
- CoWrap generated `WRAPS/CoWrap_*.md` and tag `cowrap-*`.
- BNCC combined BN sync + CC inline preparations.

## Errors & fixes
- PS parse errors from comments/backslashes → corrected.
- Version parse errors (`0.1.0.`) → hardened parser.
- `CC_InlineCores.ps1` needs explicit parameters (documented as missing).

## Outcome
- Reproducible **download → run → auto-clean** cycle in place.
- BN canonical guard enabled; safety workflow present; seeds installed.
