# CoSuite Session Summary (Canonical) — 2025-10-14

## Essence of the session
- **North Star:** *Make a proof you can stand behind — offline.*
- **Core differentiators:** Stateless operation; sealed/scored methods; COI/recusal guardrails; deterministic redaction; tamper-evident Evidence Packs with reproducibility.
- **Go-to-market reality:** Lead with one low-heat, data-rich policy case (OGAT+) that punishes plain AI and rewards provable process. Avoid platform sprawl and political minefields.
- **Community physics:** Viral open-core with a hard spine. Fund **proof bounties** (artifacts), not feature bounties.

## Main directions
1) **MVP (internal):** Use CoAgent to 10× setup of CoSuite by generating Evidence Packs, Registries, and Neutral Briefs quickly and reproducibly.
2) **MVR (breakout):** OGAT+ — Open Grants Transparency with COI & Redaction Guardrails — one-sitting mission with signed outputs.
3) **Onboarding:** Mission-first (5–45 min), local-first, single-button steps, no account, one artifact at the end (page/zip). Hide complexity until after first success.
4) **Telemetry & trust:** Default zero. Opt-in with receipts + differential privacy; public transparency log. Learn from structure/outcomes, never payloads.
5) **Congruence & CoIndexing:** Export weight choices (method.json). Seed a Purposeful Ideation Unit (PIU) schema for future concept-first indexing.

## Key points (bullet extraction)
- **Users to target now:** NGO/foundation & city program ops; later defense/legal/procurement with sealed tender.
- **Artifacts > words:** Evidence Pack is the viral object; Proof Page is the ad.
- **Kill gates:** If TtFP misses (demo >15 min / real >45 min) or reproducibility <80%, stop marketing and fix determinism first.
- **Success KPIs:** TtFP, Pack export rate, COI attest count, Redaction presence, Reproducibility pass, Artifact-footer inbound.

## Advice with immediate impact (CoAgent & CoSuite)
- Ship **Stateless Mode** hard switch and document what’s blocked.
- Implement **co seal**, **co attest**, **co redact**, **co pack reproduce**.
- Bundle OGAT+ demo: sample CSV, redaction policy, COI form, AI-use declaration, sealed-weights template.
- Publish schemas (`method.schema.json`, `pack_manifest.schema.json`) and keep them versioned and testable.
- Freeze brand spine for 24 months: *Provable public outcomes.*

## Risks & mitigations
- **Perceived bias** → export weights & rationale; show method diffs.
- **Brand sprawl** → ban new product names through P2; all roads lead to CoAgent “Proof Studio”.
- **Telemetry fear** → receipts + audits + DP; user-controlled relay.
- **Political blowback** → pick low-heat policies first; pivot to Health Inspections if grants become heated.

## Integration pointers
- **Advice Bomb (canonical):** OGAT+ breakout guidance (see payload/advice).
- **Inspiration Pack:** Theses, patterns, PIU schema/examples, specs for Stateless, Telemetry, COI, Redaction (see payload/inspiration).
- **Installer script:** `payload/scripts/install_to_cocache.ps1` installs advice into `CoCache/AdviceBombs/AB-CoAgent-Breakout`.
