# Session Transcript — CoEvolution of Documents (condensed)
Date: 2025-10-09 20:24

## Highlights
- Defined **CoGenetics / CoGenes**: persistent units of meaning and their lineage.
- Proposed **tiered sensitivity** (Experimental, Draft, Established, Canonical) with voting/gates.
- **Human‑gate** for significant changes; routine fixes autonomous.
- **Metadata schema** for CoGenes (IDs, lineage, adoption, constraints, ethics, bp_alignment).
- UX cues via hover chips/badges; CoGene‑aware diffs.
- Repo **maturity stages**: Seed → Foundation → Launch → Post‑Launch.
- **Hybrid minds/biotech** guardrails and crossover policies.
- Created **Idea Card** and an **Insights** explainer; attempted packaging for download.
