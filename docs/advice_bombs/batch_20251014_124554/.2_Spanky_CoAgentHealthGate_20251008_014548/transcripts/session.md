# Session Transcript (Condensed)

**Window:** start→now  
**Focus:** PC performance reliability for CoAgent/CoCivium™ BPOE workflows; Calculator spam root-cause; HealthGate preflight; repo advisories; PR automation; stall-out guidance.

## Key Steps
1. Captured symptoms: mouse multi-clicks, PrintScreen failing, Calculator auto-spawning (20–30 instances), PS profile errors, DISM freeze, Defender exclusions failing, network OK.
2. Ran host checks (disk TRIM on, SSD healthy, free space sufficient, NIC at 1 Gbps, error counters clear). Confirmed High Performance power plan.
3. Identified fragile PowerShell profile imports; warned against auto-launch; proposed **HealthGate** (read-only preflight).
4. Delivered **Advice Bomb** for scope guardrails + HealthGate checklist.
5. Seeded `CoAgent` repo with:
   - `advisories/AB-HealthGate-Scope-v1.0.md`
   - `modules/HealthGate.ps1` (report to `health/`)
   - `tools/Run-HealthGate.ps1`
6. Branch protection blocked direct pushes → created **PR #55** (`ab-healthgate-v1-...`) with auto-merge.
7. Fixed PS profile; added **Session Stallouts** advisory; added tools:
   - `tools/Watch-HotkeyStorm.ps1` (traces Calculator spawns)
   - `tools/Disable-AppKeyCalculator.ps1` (neutralizes AppKey 18)
8. Rebuilt `HealthGate.ps1` markdown builder (parser-safe). Verified run.
9. Lessons learned recorded in **CoCivium™** insights.

## Notable Outputs
- HealthGate reports: markdown + JSON; verdict PASS/WARN with issues list.
- Stallouts guidance for CoAgent UX & logging strategy.
- Hotkey storm detection and AppKey neutralization utilities.
