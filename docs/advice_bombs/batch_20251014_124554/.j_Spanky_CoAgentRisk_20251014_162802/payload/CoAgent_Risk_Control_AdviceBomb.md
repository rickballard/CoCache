# CoAgent Advice Bomb: AI Risk & Control Map

## 1. Introduction & Scope
This document outlines a comprehensive strategy for risk management in AI orchestration environments like CoAgent, ensuring user data sovereignty and system-level privacy.

## 2. Key AI Risks
- Data leakage & retention
- Model manipulation & collusion
- Vendor lock-in
- Regulatory non-compliance
- Adversarial interactions
- Contextual overreach ("session bloat")

## 3. Defense Strategies
- Encryption at rest/in-transit
- Local/on-prem processing
- Federated learning & differential privacy
- Adapter/gateway plugins with policy enforcement
- Session lifecycle control (context archiving)
- User deletion & transparency tools

## 4. Role of CoAgent
CoAgent is envisioned as:
- A data gatekeeper across AIs
- A modular container for safely invoking LLMs/tools
- A policy enforcement engine with memory & lifecycle control
- A privacy-first front-end for human interaction

## 5. Next Steps
- Integrate this framework into CoAudit or CoSuite repositories
- Generate templates and compliance checklists
- Use as base for community-contributed risk profiles and plugins
