# Executive Summary (CoSuite Advice Bomb)

- Approach external researchers with **one concrete artifact** and a **20‑minute critique ask**, not a manifesto.
- Operationalize **auditability** (guardrails logs, hash‑chains) and **dataflow visibility** (SDK/adtech “glass‑box”) with **falsifiable metrics**.
- InSeed shows up as **pay‑it‑forward micro‑grants** (no equity/IP/authorship) only when site copy is live.
- This package includes email templates, 2‑pager scaffolds, demo storyboard, pre‑send verifier, and BPOE checklists.
