# Vision Flagship — Mudfling to Lightring

## 1. Opening hook
A short page that introduces Mudfling → Lighring, the grove image, and why this matters now.

> From meeting to meaning.

<details><summary>Expand for full context</summary>
Modern work is haunted by the Mudfling: meetings where words fly, nothing lands, and energy leaks away.
The Vision Flagship introduces the opposite pattern — the Lightring. A pause, a circle, a grove, where words slow and shared clarity forms.
This is storyboard, ritual sketch, and flagship metaphor — enough to make CME imaginable in under five minutes.
