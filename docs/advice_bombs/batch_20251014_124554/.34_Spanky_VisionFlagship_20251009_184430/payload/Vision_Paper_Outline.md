Modern work is haunted by the Mudfling: meetings where words fly, nothing lands, and energy leaks away.
The Vision Flagship introduces the opposite pattern — the Lightring. A pause, a circle, a grove, where words slow and shared clarity forms.

This is not product design. It is **storyboard**, **ritual sketch**, and **flagship metaphor**. Enough to make CME (Collective Mindshare Environment) imaginable in under 5 minutes.

Sponsors should read this not in “clinical mode” but in “vision mode.” Educators may find lesson plans hidden in the imagery. Citizens can simply smile at the thought that meetings need not always be hell.
