# Session Transcript Digest — CoMap (Governance Radar / Spider Tool)

**Scope:** Strategy and plan for “CoMap,” a top-level map in a family of future maps rendering governance and civilization metrics; staged initially as a CoModule with potential to become a standalone viral product.

**Key Threads Covered**
- Need for a **methodology** to define and calculate metrics for comparing governance/civilization models.
- **Spider/radar diagram** with immutable vertices (metrics) and adjustable scores; each governance model forms a polygon.
- Inclusion of **fictional** (Star Trek, Star Wars, The Expanse) and **real-world** (Nordics, USA, China, Russia, DPRK, Iran, EU) comparisons, plus **CoCivium Ideal** benchmark.
- **Virality & UX**: shareable outputs, overlays, guided mode, gallery, challenges, AI copilot, watermarking, embed widgets.
- **Staging & Placement**: Start as **CoModule**, likely under CoCivium `insights/`; may graduate to its **own repo** (“CoMap”) as traction grows. Decisions mediated by **CoCache** and possibly **CoSteward**.
- **Novice-editable** yet **structurally consistent** diagrams (lock vertices; allow weights/scores); attribution to CoCivium.
- Deliverable intent: **downloadable app** (PWA/Electron) + **backend** for templates/gallery, with JSON-based configs.

**Outcomes/Decisions**
- Name: **CoMap** (top-level map; front door into CoCivium/CoSuite).
- MVP includes: sliders, overlays (Federation/Empire/Nordics/USA/CoCivium Ideal), export (PNG/JSON/embed), watermark.
- Directory skeleton for future repo provided in payload.
- Methodology + example **metrics set** + **templates** drafted (payload).
