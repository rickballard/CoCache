# Methodology (v0.1)

**Principles**
- **Transparency:** Public, inspectable metric definitions and scoring logic.
- **Non‑coercion:** Scores are descriptive, not prescriptive; multiple pathways to improvement.
- **Comparability:** Immutable metric set for version series; versioned changes only.

**Scoring**
- Each metric is scored 0–100 for a given governance model.
- **Evidence layers:** empirical indicators (e.g., Freedom House proxies), expert synthesis, and community annotations.
- **Weights:** Default equal; users may adjust *weights* for exploration, but raw scores remain distinct.

**Aggregation**
- Weighted average for composite score; display per-metric polygon to avoid “flattening.”
- Confidence intervals shown as band shading (future).

**Governance Models**
- Fictional templates (Federation, Empire) are illustrative; clearly marked.
- Real-world templates reference public indices (to be cited in `/summaries/SOURCES.md`).

**Ethical Guardrails**
- No ranking without sources; highlight uncertainty.
- Open rebuttal mechanism via gallery comments and versioned PRs.
