# BPOE Notes

- Use **CoModule staging**; graduate to standalone repo (`CoMap`) if traction warrants.
- Prefer **PWA** for frictionless distribution; offer Electron pack later for offline/desktop.
- All exports include **watermark + link** to CoCiviumâ„¢.
- Maintain **versioned metrics schema**; tool displays schema version on exports.
- Integrate with **CoCache** and **CoWrap** logs for traceability.
