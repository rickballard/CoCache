# Session Transcript (Condensed)

**Scope**: MeritRank CI (GitHub Actions), branch protection, PR flows, README de-duplication.
**When**: up to 20251009_184459 UTC

### Highlights
- Workflow `merit-badge.yml` runs on **push**, **pull_request**, **workflow_dispatch**.
- `badge` job: build + artifact upload; **required** status = `badge`.
- `deploy` job: gated with `if: github.event_name != 'pull_request'`; Pages only from `main`.
- Branch protection simplified to require just `badge` on `main`.
- Used `gh workflow run ... --ref <branch>`; watched runs with `gh run list/watch`.
- README duplicate `# MeritRank` header removed via PR #37.
- Sanity checks: Pages badge endpoint returns 200; main workflow success.

### Pitfalls Fixed
- `gh run list` CLI parsing: use `--limit 1` and `--json` rather than brittle `-q` in PS.
- Branch protection API required `contexts` as an **array** even for one item.
- Avoided Pages deployment on PR to prevent environment contention.
