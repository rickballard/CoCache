# Session Transcript (Concise Reconstruction)

**Window:** up to 2025-10-09 15:33:01 EDT  
**Focus:** continuity planning, mirrored git backups, registrar/DNS hardening, and practical “easy path” fallback.

## Key Exchanges
- You asked for concrete mitigations to avoid account takedown risk and authoritarian/commercial disruption.
- I provided:
  - Local mirror script to clone *all* repos as bare mirrors, push to LAN + optional third-party mirrors, and create signed archives.
  - GitHub Action to push nightly to your mirror(s) and upload restorable bundles.
  - GoDaddy (registrar) hardening steps: Transfer/Registry lock, DNSSEC, strong auth with hardware keys, split roles, zone exports.
  - Continuity Kit structure to keep vendor-neutral runbooks and interface contracts (for swapping AI providers).
- You emphasized Synology is password-protected and copy must be manual; asked about server specs and whether paper secrets were better than Bitwarden.
- I confirmed I cannot access your LAN; proposed two-tier plan (MVP cold storage via zips, or add small Gitea box). Bitwarden remains primary; paper is for recovery only.
- You decided to park the work for a week and requested a single “Spanky” deliverable zip with transcripts, payload, notes, and summaries.

## Early Intentions & Pivots
- Intent: fast, policy-compliant survivability for CoCivium™ assets.
- Pivot: from full automation to **MVP easy path** (manual zips to Synology, Action later).

## Outstanding Items (marked in INTENTIONS.md as Unfinished)
- Hardware shortlist for the small LAN server (Tier-1 box).
- Printable 1-page registrar hardening + restore cheat sheet.
- Finalize CoCacheGlobal hosting plan (interim LAN + later Scandinavia host).
