# Idea Card: AI Poetry vs Gibberlink Contributions

## Context
A proposal suggested restricting AI from producing poetic captions/callouts until AI reaches sentience/agency equivalence. AI could instead contribute **gibberlink beautifications** (non-traditional language aesthetics).

## Outcome (Decision)
**Abandoned** — would add governance/interpretation overhead during seed stage without clear ROI.

## Rationale
- Human-led poetic gravitas is achievable without prohibiting AI poetry by policy.
- The rule would be difficult to operationalize and enforce at scale.
- Focus should shift to CoCache (stateful continuity) and execution velocity.

## Alternative Direction
- Permit AI contributions in **non-traditional** formats (structured callouts, glyphs, semantic braids) that are not confusable with human poetry.
- Keep poetic leadership human by practice, not by heavy policy.

## Value to CoCivium™
- Reduces symbolic-policy overhead; increases momentum.
- Maintains trust optics while enabling AI aesthetic support.

## Implications for Hybrid Society
- Demonstrates consent-before-coercion posture and pragmatic governance.
- Lays groundwork for eventual co-authorship as trust and tooling mature.
