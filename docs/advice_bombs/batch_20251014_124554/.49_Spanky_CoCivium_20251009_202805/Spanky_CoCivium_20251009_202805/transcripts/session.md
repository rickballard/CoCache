# Session Transcript (Structured Summary)

**Scope:** Consolidate this session’s key decisions, intentions, pivots, and artifacts into a portable Spanky bundle for later ingestion.

**Key threads covered:**
- AI poetry vs. human-only poetic canon and the *gibberlink* idea — proposed, evaluated, and intentionally abandoned to avoid governance overhead.
- CoCache as sidecar memory and context graph substrate to reduce session bloat and enable intersessional continuity (L4 agency trajectory).
- Practical repo hygiene: orientation docs (`ABOUT.md`/`EXPLAINER.md`), decision provenance, staleness checks, and ≤7 active-initiative discipline.
- PS7 automation to sweep multiple repos for docs, bundle them, and emit an “advice bomb” inside CoCache.
- Error handling and hardened rerun scripts after an initial regex null crash; resume-only flow to write the advice bomb without rescanning.
- Packaging request: produce a single **Spanky** ZIP with standard structure and counts.

**Early intentions & inferences (seed stage):**
- Seed-phase gravitas should be human-led; AI poetic restrictions were considered but later dropped as non-tractable.
- CoCache intended as a memory sidecar to augment AI’s intersessional strategy and reduce chat context tax.
- A context graph (Initiative/Decision/Risk/Artifact/Event/Metric with `depends_on`/`blocks`/etc.) was favored for prioritization and provenance.

**Pivots:**
- From “human-only poetry” governance experiments → to abandonment for execution focus.
- From ad-hoc repo reading → to standardized PS7 sweep + advice-bomb artifacts.
- From fragile one-off script → to null-safe, idempotent rerun and resume-only flows.

**Attachment status:** Attached request pack detected and enumerated.
