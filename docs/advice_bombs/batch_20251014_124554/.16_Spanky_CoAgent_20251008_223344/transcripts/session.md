# Spanky Request — v2.2 (Deep-Capture + Deprecations)

**Goal:** force sessions to capture *everything that matters* including early intentions, pivots, risks, deprecated ideas, and web references — and return **one downloadable zip**.


## Your task
Return **one downloadable zip** named:
`Spanky_<ShortName>_<YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS>.zip`

### Required structure
/_spanky/
  _copayload.meta.json
  _wrap.manifest.json
  out.txt
  checksums.json
/transcripts/
  session.md
/payload/
  ... (deliverables)
/notes/
  BPOE.md
  INTENTIONS.md
  DEPENDENCIES.md
  DECISIONS.md
  ASSUMPTIONS.md
  RISKS.md
  GLOSSARY.md
  WEBSITE_MANIFEST.md
  DEPRECATED.md        # record ideas dropped, with rationale
/summaries/
  TLDR.md
  ROADMAP_NOTES.md
  SOURCES.md

> If something is unavailable, include a file with: MISSING_<WHAT>.

### Mandatory rewind
Before packaging, re-read from the start and include:
- Unfinished intentions → INTENTIONS.md
- Workflow/BPOE improvements → BPOE.md
- Pivots/abandoned drafts → ROADMAP_NOTES.md + DEPRECATED.md
- Risks/assumptions/decisions → respective files

### DEPRECATED.md format
- Idea/Initiative: <short name>
- Why dropped: <reason>
- When dropped: <session context / date>
- What it evolved into (if anything): <link or note>
