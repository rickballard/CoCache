# BPOE (Block of Productive Execution) â€” Working Standard
BPOE is the CoAgent convention for packaging repeatable, idempotent work as self-describing blocks.
**Principles:** (1) reproducible, (2) idempotent, (3) small/atomic when heavy, (4) echo meaningful progress, (5) safe defaults.

**This pack uses a staged BPOE:** S1 metadata (done), S2 notes (this file set), S3 summaries, S4/5 payloads, S6 finalize.
