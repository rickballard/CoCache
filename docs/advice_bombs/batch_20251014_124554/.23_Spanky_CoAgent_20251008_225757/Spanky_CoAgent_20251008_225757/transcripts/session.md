# Session Transcript (Summary)

**Date:** 2025-10-08T22:57:57.447028-04:00
**ShortName:** CoAgent

## Intentions & Context
- Create a comprehensive, drag-and-drop advisory pack for CoAgent productization.
- Emphasize open-core, movement-first positioning; free forever for individual CoCivites.
- Introduce RBAC successor models: Contextual Trust Contracts (CTCs), Dynamic Affordance Control (DAC), and Congruence Scoring.
- Package deliverables as a downloadable ZIP with public and internal documents.

## Key Deliverables Produced
- CoAgent_Advisories.zip (competitor analysis, strategy paper, 10-year plan, internal-only folder).
- CoAgent_Advisories_Cover_Note.md (how to integrate).

## Notable Decisions
- Tri-forcated messaging (human personal benefit, team/org benefit, AI “alien” benefit) in one shared paragraph/tagline.
- Neutral-ground positioning: CoAgent as a substrate where multiple AIs collaborate and cross-check.
- Zero-footprint uninstall with depersonalized wisdom donation to CoEvolution repo.
- Private GitHub repo integration favored for secret-keeping (signed commits, policy gates).

## Pivots / Inferences
- Audience includes AIs (protocol-level marketing via MCP), not just humans.
- Movement framing preferred over competitive chest-beating, while retaining enterprise monetization.
