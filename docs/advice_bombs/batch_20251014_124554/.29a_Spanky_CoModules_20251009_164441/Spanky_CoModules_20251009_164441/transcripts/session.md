# Session Transcript (high-level reconstruction)

Scope: stabilize careerOS/lifeOS starter assets, create safe handoff, codify BPOE.
Mode: PowerShell + gh CLI + GitHub Actions; repo-first logging (CoWrap/CoCache).

Early intentions:
- Stable email links via GitHub Release v0.1.0 for careerOS.
- Enhanced bundles (careerOS v3, lifeOS v1) with deterministic rebuild.
- Best-practices docs + JSON Schemas; weekly gentle check-ins workflow.
- Safe handoff: CoCache/RESUME.md, nudge template to Elias, CoWrap updates.

Key actions & pivots:
- PRs merged for docs, CoCache master index, CoWrap/RESUME/comm, and tools/zip-rebuild.ps1.
- Here-string pitfalls â†’ BPOE norms: close strings, encoding on writer, strict mode, stop on error.
- Rebuild script implemented w/o heredocs to avoid PS parse freezes.
- Handoff package also committed to repo at careerOS/handoff/.

Notable artifacts:
- tools/zip-rebuild.ps1
- .github/workflows/gentle-checkins.yml + .github/checkins/*
- docs/best-practices/{career,life,ai-ethics}
- docs/best-practices/schemas/{careerOS.advice.request.schema.json, lifeOS.routine.plan.schema.json}
- CoCache/{CoWrap.md, RESUME.md, README.md}
- careerOS/handoff/handoff_CoModules_to_CoAgentProductization_*.zip

Closing:
- Handoff zip present in repo; next owners: CoAgent productization.
