# Advice & Packaging Notes (for Implementation Sessions)

- Treat this bundle as **guidance**. Implementation planning/execution should happen in downstream sessions (CoAgent productization, CoCore schema work, Conformance harness build).
- Keep specs minimal and stable; ship examples and tests before adding features.
- Do NOT use culture terms (e.g., “having a chomsky”) in normative text, metrics, or tests.
- Protect secret-sauce (HP57) by policy and repo structure; beacon only public contexts/capabilities.
