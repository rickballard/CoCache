**Window:** 2025-10-09 (single-session capture)

## Key actions
- Built a paste-ready userspace sandbox draft for `User:WeTheHonestPeople/sandbox` (neutral skeleton; sections: Overview, History, Technology, Reception, See also, References).
- Added precise DO steps for saving, adding a COI disclosure, and later moving to `Draft:CoCivium` and submitting via AfC.
- Clarified that **Substack/self-published** sources are not independent; advised to use third-party editorial sources only.
- Advised against creating neologism/term pages without multiple independent sources.
- Provided click-path to create the user page via `Special:MyPage` and to publish the COI note.
- Diagnosed screens the user encountered (guideline page; redlink notice) and gave fixes.
- Confirmed current state: **no independent coverage** ⇒ keep draft in userspace and work on generating third-party sources.

## Artifacts packaged here
- Wikitext skeletons and checklists captured in notes.
- Status file, manifest, and checksums to comply with Spanky v2.2.
