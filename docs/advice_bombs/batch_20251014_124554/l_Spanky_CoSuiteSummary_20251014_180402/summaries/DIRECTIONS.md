# Directions
1) Ship the pipeline, not opinions.
2) Standardize metrics early and enforce via lints.
3) Guard rights via HumanGate; publish sub-scores not a magic composite.
4) Make uncertainty explicit (evidence ≠ measurement ≠ effect).
5) Limit WIP, prefer throughput; kill staleness with watchdogs.
6) Instrument from day one: minimal dashboards (effect, CI, rights, equity spread, stability, tempo).
