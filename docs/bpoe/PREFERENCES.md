# BPOE Preferences (v1)

- Code blocks SHOULD show a clear end-marker in long DO blocks to reduce mid-render pastes.
- UI preference: copy button at the BOTTOM of each DO block. (Recorded; implement when UI is under our control.)
- Default to single-quoted here-strings when generating scripts to avoid expansion.
- Avoid pipeline/switch for multi-line ops; prefer `foreach($file in $files)`.
