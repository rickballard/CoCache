# BPOE Preauthorizations (v1)

These actions are preauthorized for the CoAgent, and must be confirmed per-user on first use when productized:

- Update BPOE docs, workflows, and planning documents without asking.
- Create/modify intake normalizers and logging in CoCache.
- Write session CoWraps and index maps in `CoCache/intake/...`.
- Add/adjust .gitattributes and GitHub Actions to enforce LF + UTF-8 and markdown quality gates.

Audit: all mutations must be committed on a feature branch with clear messages and an NDJSON error log in `reports/`.
