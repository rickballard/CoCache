# BPOE / Seed-Stage Wisdom

- One small **DO runner** that unpacks and orchestrates a **single mega ZIP** (timestamped filename).
- All downloaded artifacts **must** be timestamped in the filename.
- PS7 long-running ops print **dot-rows** so the user sees progress.
- During seed stage, validation **skips** are allowed for known bulk payload trees (e.g. `docs/advice_bombs/`).
