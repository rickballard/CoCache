Reflex Pattern â€” ACTIONABLE BPOE NOTICE

- All Stage bundles include DO_SmokeTest_*.ps1
- Emissions: out.txt + optional .sig.json
- CoCache should ingest for health, divergence, and session sync logs
- Store known output hashes per asset version under: CoCache/docs/reflex/hashes/
- Reflex tests = minimal correctness/sanity, not full harness
- Any session changing asset logic re-emits Reflex logs and notifies CoSync
