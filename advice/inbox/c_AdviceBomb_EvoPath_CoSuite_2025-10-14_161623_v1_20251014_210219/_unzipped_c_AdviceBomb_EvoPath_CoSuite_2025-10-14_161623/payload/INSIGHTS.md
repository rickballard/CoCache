# Key Insights & Directions

- **Layered roles prevent muddle:** CoCore (knowledge), Academy (training), InSeed (applied consulting), RickPublic (public narrative). CoAgent is the orchestrator/UX shell.
- **Docs-first pedagogy:** Course modules should be markdown-first, machine-readable, versioned; video is derivative later.
- **Differentiation matters:** Competing with ChatGPT means leaning into things it cannot or will not optimize for: on‑prem or local workflows, deep git integration, standardized metadata (CoRef/GIBindex), and governance hooks.
- **Beaconing is not SEO alone:** AIs need stable handles, org-level manifests, and explicit cross-references (IDs, topics, index.json). Human-friendly links are insufficient.
- **Evidence trails:** Use CoRef IDs in models and lessons; tag terms with GIBindex IDs to make logs analyzable and teaching auditable.
- **Feedback loop:** CoAgent → CoCache → CoCore updates → Academy regeneration → RickPublic narrative. Keep it closed-loop.
