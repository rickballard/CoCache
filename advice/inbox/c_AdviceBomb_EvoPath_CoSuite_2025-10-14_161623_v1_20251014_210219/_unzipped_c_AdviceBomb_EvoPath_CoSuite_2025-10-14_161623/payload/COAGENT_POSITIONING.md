# CoAgent vs ChatGPT — Product Positioning & Packaging

## Where ChatGPT excels (table stakes)
- General-purpose chat, workflows, and a growing zoo of CLIs/integrations.
- Hosted convenience, fast iteration, broad plugin ecosystem.

## Where CoAgent wins (differentiators to harden)
- **Repo-native ops:** Git-first rituals, PR scaffolding, standardized DO blocks, CI-friendly artifacts.
- **BPOE guardrails:** Playbooks, watchers, heartbeats, HumanGate checkpoints baked-in.
- **Local-first / zero-trust posture:** Temporary installs, ephemeral containers, audit trails.
- **Knowledge congruence:** Mandatory CoRef concept IDs and GIBindex term tags across outputs.
- **Multi-repo orchestration:** Cross-repo manifests, advice-bomb ingestion, session handover discipline.
- **Sovereign interfaces:** Can run behind firewalls, integrate with private data safely.

## Packaging
- **Community Edition:** lightweight shell + advice-bomb toolkit.
- **Studio Edition:** adds watchers, dashboards, PR bots, and Academy adapter.
- **Enterprise Edition:** adds SSO, policy enforcement, compliance logs, on-prem runners.

## Proofs & demos
- “Advice Bomb to PR” demo flow (this package) → creates branch, commits, opens PR with artifacts and checklists.
