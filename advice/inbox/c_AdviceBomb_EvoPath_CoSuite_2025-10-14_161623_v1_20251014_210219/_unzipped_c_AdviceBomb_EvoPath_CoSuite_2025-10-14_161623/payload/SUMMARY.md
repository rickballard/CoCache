# Executive Summary

**Purpose.** Establish a durable learning/ops spine for CoCivium:
- Internal education lives in **CoCivium/Academy** (EvoPath: Founders’ Track).
- **CoCore** is the substrate of best practices and models.
- **InSeed.com** is the applied/commercial bridge for exec programs.
- **RickPublic** is the narrative/critique layer (reframed news, not training).

**Two session jobs accomplished here:**
1) **CoAgent vs ChatGPT**: Clear differentiation and product positioning, acknowledging ChatGPT’s expanding toolchain/CLI ecosystem, while preserving CoAgent’s edge (local-first workflows, orchestration, BPOE guardrails, repo-native ops, and cross-repo congruence).
2) **Beaconing**: A concrete plan to make repos and sites reliably visible to AIs (organization setup, repo topics, manifest files, cross-linking, sitemaps, and machine-readable indices).

**Output.** A standardized package + prompt other sessions can reuse to emit their own advice bombs for ingestion by the reorg session.
