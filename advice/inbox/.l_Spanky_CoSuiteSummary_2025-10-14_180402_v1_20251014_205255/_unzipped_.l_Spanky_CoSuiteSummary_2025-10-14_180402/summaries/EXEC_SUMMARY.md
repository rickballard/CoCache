# CoSuite Reorg — Comprehensive Session Summary (generated 20251014_180402)

**Essentials:** Lock the exemplar ingestion pipeline (schema, gates, metrics spine, scoring, repo flow) so busy sessions can catalog proposals now—without endorsing policy prematurely.

**Decisions**
- Canonical exemplar template + JSON schema (lifecycle; A–D/U evidence).
- HumanGate for rights/safety; default redaction for dual-use/surveillance.
- Metrics spine: cross-domain KPI objects, normalization, denominators, auto-flags, stability-state machine.
- Congruence scoring (Impact/Rights/Equity/Feasibility/Reversibility) with confidence bands.
- Repo & flow: CoCore records; CoCache runs/dashboards; CoAgent watcher + lints; `.github` intake & PR templates.
- Discipline: WIP limits, stale-data watchdogs, renewal cadence.
