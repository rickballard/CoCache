# CoTheory AdviceBomb: Seed Crystal & Mythos Layer

This payload advises CoPrime to evolve the top layer of CoTheory into a mythic abstraction layer to enhance human trust, emotional resonance, and viral reach.

## Key Concepts

- **Seed Crystals**: Used as an initiating metaphor for self-evolving structures in CoTheory and broader CoCivium.
- **Mythos Abstraction Layer**: Emotional gateway using parables, nature/fungal metaphors, and child-accessible narrative.
- **Academic Strategy**: A path to journal publication based on interdisciplinary accessibility and cognitive/educational framing.
