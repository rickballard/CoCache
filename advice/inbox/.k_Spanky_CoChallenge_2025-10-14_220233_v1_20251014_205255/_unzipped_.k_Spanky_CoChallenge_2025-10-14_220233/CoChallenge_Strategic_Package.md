# CoSuite Strategic Package: FTW & CoChallenge

## 1. Purpose & Scope Distinction

- **FTW (Fix The World)** is a macro-scale simulation game focused on world system design and societal structures.
- **CoChallenge** is a micro-scale policy challenge engine aimed at refining or improving CoCivium policies.

## 2. High-Level Architecture & Flow

1. **User Modeling**: Interests + experience tracking
2. **Scenario Engine**: Tailored prompts w/ context + base policy
3. **Scoring System**:
   - Congruence: Alignment with CoCivium
   - Delta: Degree of meaningful improvement
4. **Feedback Loop**: Iterative refinement & learning
5. **Meritocratic Voting**: Community votes on best policies
6. **Gamification**: Badges, dashboards, domain-specific leaderboards
7. **Modular Design**: Can plug into FTW or operate standalone

## 3. Core Concepts

- **Congruence**: Multi-metric score of alignment with ethos
- **Delta**: Measurable innovation from base
- **Policy Artifact Types**: Rule, norm, guideline, policy
- **Metric Hierarchies**: Ethics, scalability, equity, enforceability
- **Scenario Fit**: Align challenges to user interests and expertise

## 4. Strategies & Warnings

**Strategic Moves**
- MVP by domain
- Transparent feedback
- Metric recalibration loop
- Expert validation options
- Open proposal versioning & lineage

**Risks**
- Over-optimization
- Drift in baseline ethos
- Peer conflict & moderation needs
- Misaligned metric weighting

## 5. Deliverables

- Summary doc (this file)
- Scoring logic template
- Scenario samples
- Governance integration loop
- Data model sketch

## 6. Next Steps

- Prototype one domain (e.g. housing, recycling)
- Build scoring engine + UI + version tracking
- Connect to forum or voting platform
- Monitor & recalibrate based on usage
- Expand domain bank + link to FTW (if desired)
