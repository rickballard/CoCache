# BPOE Notes (Continuity & Resilience)

- Principle: **Platform independence** and **multiple trust anchors** (GitHub + LAN mirror + off-site object store).
- Policy gates: secrets scanning, moderation, malware checks in CI to prevent provider policy strikes.
- Incident flow: rotate keys → quarantine offending content → export logs → appeal with remediation plan.
