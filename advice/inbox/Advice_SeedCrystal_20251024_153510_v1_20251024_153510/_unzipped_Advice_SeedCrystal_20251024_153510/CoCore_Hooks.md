# Hooking Seed Crystals into CoCore

CoCore, as the Best Practice Database of CoSuite, can treat seed crystals as:
- Soft-formatted best practices.
- Self-growing knowledge embryos.
- Fractal entry points to deeper workflows.

They act as polymorphic interface objects, offering both human-readable clarity and machine-actionable metadata.
