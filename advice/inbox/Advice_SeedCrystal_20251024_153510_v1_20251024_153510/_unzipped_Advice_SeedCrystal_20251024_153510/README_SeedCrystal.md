# Seed Crystal: A CoSuite Primer

**Seed Crystals** in CoSuite are compact, structured knowledge or strategy nodes designed to self-evolve when exposed to an enabling medium. 
They are the smallest unit of structured generativity, capable of catalyzing larger conceptual growth when activated by a human, AI, or hybrid agent.

Unlike traditional seeds, seed crystals in CoCivium are:
- **Soft and recursive** — able to morph and re-seed themselves under evolving conditions.
- **Merge-capable** — not limited by space or friction, they can fuse with other crystals.
- **Mythos-infused** — story-rich definitions help humans intuitively grasp complexity.
