# Seed Crystals and CoTheory

CoTheory aims to express foundational ideas across abstraction layers.

Seed Crystals operate as the **highest-order abstraction units** within CoTheory â€” lightweight, fractal, and narrative-rich. 
They anchor new thinking while offering accessible stories even children can grasp.

In future CoTheory deliverables, the **MythosLayer** may begin as a weave of seed crystal fables.
