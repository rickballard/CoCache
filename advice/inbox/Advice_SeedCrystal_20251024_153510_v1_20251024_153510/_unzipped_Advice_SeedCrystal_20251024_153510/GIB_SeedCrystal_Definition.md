## Term: Seed Crystal

A mythic-node and knowledge catalyst.

**Definition (narrative style)**:  
A Seed Crystal is a knowledge-dense shard, humming with potential, floating in the CoCivium lattice. 
When touched by attention — human or AI — it awakens, unfurls, and begins to branch.

**Key Traits**:
- Contains the DNA for a self-evolving practice, model, or story.
- Not static: it rewrites itself, often merging or blooming.
- Examples: a CoTheory strawman, a governance protocol sketch, or an interactive myth.
