# Reflex Pattern AdviceBomb

This package introduces the concept of a **Reflex Pattern** in the CoSuite ecosystem.
Reflex is defined as a pattern-detection mechanism that enables CoSuite to evaluate its **own responses to internal or external stimuli** in real time or near real time.

## Purpose
Reflex is a **meta-evolutionary watchdog**, helping detect:
- Session divergence
- Looping behavior
- Repetitive or incoherent outputs
- Trigger cascades (e.g., runaway file/gen operations)
- Inconsistencies across parallel workflows

## Package Use
- For immediate implementation: run the provided `DO_QuickRegister.ps1`
- For delayed implementation: read `ROADMAP_NOTES.md` and stage items for later
