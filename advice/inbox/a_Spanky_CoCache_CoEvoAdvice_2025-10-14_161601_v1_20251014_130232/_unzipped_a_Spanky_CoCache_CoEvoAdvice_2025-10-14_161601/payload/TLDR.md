# TL;DR â€” What to Do Next
1) Put CoCache in L1 advisory mode across CoAgent, CoCore, CoRef.
2) Start heartbeats and proposal PRs; no auto-merges yet.
3) Improve front porches: demos, examples, good-first issues.
4) Define guardrails and consent in `.cocache.yml` per repo.
5) Prepare CoCacheGlobal for ballots on interface changes.
6) Publish CoCivia `intent.manifest.json` when governance is live.
