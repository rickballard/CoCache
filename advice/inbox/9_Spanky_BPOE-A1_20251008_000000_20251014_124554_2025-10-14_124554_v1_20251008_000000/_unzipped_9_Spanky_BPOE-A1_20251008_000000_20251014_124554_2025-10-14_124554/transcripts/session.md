# Session Transcript (Concise)

## Early Intent (BPOE baseline)
- Standardize **BPOE** delivery as zips with runnable installers; short DO blocks to execute local zips.
- Favor **programmatic diagrams** (JSON ➜ Mermaid ➜ HTML/SVG) to enable parsing and co-evolution.
- Keep **rich dialogue descriptions** so zips are self-explanatory.

## Mid-Session Pivots
- Switched from big DO monoliths to **zip-first** packs.
- Implemented **CoAgent G2** (daily greeting + CoCivium overlay).
- Added **SAMPLE watermark + demo chip + print rules** (Alt+S toggle, ?params).
- Introduced **HH BPOE Core** (Start/End gates, log), and **CLI utils** (spinner + git helpers).
- Fixed PS7 here-string pitfalls and quoting; moved Mermaid nodes to **square brackets** to avoid escaping errors.

## Late Consolidation
- Built **Spanky_BPOE-A1** pack, then regenerated Mermaid + viewer, and wrote **manifest, checksums, out.txt**.
- Confirmed delivery counts: see `_spanky/out.txt`.

## Known External Artifacts (not automatically included)
- **CoWraps** (imported references).
- **Advicebombs** (imported references).
- Any additional third-party or user-local files dragged into the session.
