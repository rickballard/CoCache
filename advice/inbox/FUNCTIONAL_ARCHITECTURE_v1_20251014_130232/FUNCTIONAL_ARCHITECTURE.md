# Functional Architecture & Objectives

## Purpose
Make CoCache the *learning cortex* of CoSuite — sensing signals, reasoning about them, proposing improvements,
and learning from outcomes — while preserving human safety, agency, and clarity.

## Four-Layer Functional Model
1. **Sense & Mirror** — normalize telemetry, heartbeats, lineage, interfaces.
2. **Reason & Forecast** — maintain fitness models, detect drift, forecast impact.
3. **Advise & Act** — generate proposals (docs/tests/refactors), simulate safely, open PRs.
4. **Reflect & Align** — promote wins into templates, report outcomes, tune policies.

## Architectural Objectives
- **Traceability:** Every proposal has rationale, risk, and rollback.
- **Coherence:** Minimize cross-repo API and dependency drift.
- **Human Co-Creation:** Make evolution visible, explorable, and mentor-friendly.
- **Guardrails First:** Security, privacy, licensing, data boundaries are hard constraints.
- **Attractiveness:** Repos are welcoming; onboarding ≤ 5 min; demos first.
- **Knowledge Recycling:** Extract and reuse successful patterns as templates.

## System Behaviors (Functional Requirements)
- Drift detection (code↔docs↔interfaces)
- Auto-suggestion with rollback scripts
- Contributor curation (good-first-issues; preview links)
- Cross-repo resonance (template propagation)
- Self-regulation (autonomy backoff on instability)
- Quarterly evolution reports and lineage graphs
