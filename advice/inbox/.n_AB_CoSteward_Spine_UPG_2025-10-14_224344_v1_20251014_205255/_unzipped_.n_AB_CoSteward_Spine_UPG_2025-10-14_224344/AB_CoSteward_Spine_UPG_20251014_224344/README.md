# CoSteward (RickDo) — Steward Operating Spine (Upgraded for Repo-Reorg Session)

This package seeds an **adoptable Steward spine** with a *human* WIP cap (3–4) while allowing **AI to run many streams** in parallel (tracked elsewhere). 
It includes **handoff automation** so the **repo-reorg session** can drop this into **CoCache** and open a ready-to-merge PR with checks and a checklist.
