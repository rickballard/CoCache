## Session Purpose
To stage the post-migration CoCivium repo grooming coordination, business plan finalization, indexing sweeps, and prepare for a full UpSweep/DownSweep audit after the Grand Migration session closes.

## Key Intentions (Status)
- [x] Generate and download a session plan in JSON
- [ ] Deep historical audit of repo losses (branches, commits, orphaned content)
- [ ] Create recovery registry and LEFTOVERS strategy
- [ ] Build CoRehydrator.ps1 for future session relaunch
- [ ] Sync master plan and implementation plan formats
- [ ] Sweep indexing inconsistencies and extract GIBindex terms
- [ ] Ensure all archived repo pointers (e.g. Civium) are preserved
- [ ] Resume only after Grand Migration confirms closure

## Current Status
Session parked. No actions executed. Plan safely exported.
