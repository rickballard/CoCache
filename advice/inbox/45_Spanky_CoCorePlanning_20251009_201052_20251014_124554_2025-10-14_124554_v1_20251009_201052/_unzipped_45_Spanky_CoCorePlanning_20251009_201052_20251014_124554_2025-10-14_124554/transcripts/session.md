# Session Transcript (Condensed) — CoCore Planning Handoff

**Purpose:** Close this session cleanly and hand off intent, advisories, and scaffolding to the parked post–Grand Migration *Upsweep/Downsweep* session.

**Key Decisions & Themes:**
- CoCore is the **backend civic knowledge graph**, not a tool farm. Source-of-truth for best practices, models, and case studies.
- **Neural taxonomy** adopted: CoNeura → CoClusta → CoDendra → CoSyna → CoAxa → CoGlia → CoMembra (top layers immutable/AI‑curated).
- **English-first**; US/UK initial jurisdictions; defer multilingual expansion until traction and income.
- **Scope discipline:** deep case study *one per CoClusta*, rest are extendable templates. Avoid low‑level workflow sprawl.
- **Simulation/runtime** not embedded in DB; tools attach externally. Provide **hooks & metadata**, not monolith tools.
- **Autonomy & guardrails:** HumanGate ON; pre‑authorized CoIntent protocols; reversible, auditable changes only.
- **Business plans** live in CoCache (private), zipped with *Rick2025*; public extracts synced into respective repos.
- **This session is parked** to avoid collisions with Grand Migration and concurrent site/CoAgent sessions.

**Handoff Objective:** Provide advisories, plan stubs, and a ready structure so the Upsweep session can produce a machine‑readable index, human‑friendly index, and then launch the Downsweep edits safely.
