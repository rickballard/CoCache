# Human Attraction — Front Porch vs Engine Room vs Sandbox

## Front Porch (Delight)
- 60s GIF demo and one-liner run
- 10 runnable examples and a labs/ area
- Good-first-issue shelf (≥ 10, < 60 days old)
- Clear CONTRIBUTING, style, and PR templates
- Preview links on every PR (docs/site/storybook)

## Engine Room (Safety)
- Tests, coverage, SBOM/license, secret scan
- API contracts and invariants under `coevo/`
- Reproducible scripts; rollbacks available

## Sandbox (Exploration)
- Feature flags and labs/ without API guarantees
- Prototype spaces for vibecoders and rapid UX iteration

## Automations worth having
- README auditor (porch checklist)
- Docs drift watcher
- Good-first-issue seeder from CI signals
- Badge/coverage updater
