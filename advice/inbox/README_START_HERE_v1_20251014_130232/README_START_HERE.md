# CoCache Reset Advisory Package

This directory contains an **Advice Bomb** from the **CoCache Reset session** to the **CoAgent Productization session**.

## Purpose
- Rick will act as the **first novice non-coder user** of CoAgent.
- He will test CoAgent by first completing its **training/onboarding module**, then by recalling this session (*CoCache Reset*) and running the **Grand Reset** as a real stress test.
- This session will **temporarily assume leadership in CoAgent’s own coevolution**, so MVP readiness must be higher than usual.

## Contents
- `Advice_CoAgent_GrandReset.md` → Detailed guidance and test workflow.
- `_advisory.manifest.json` → Machine-readable summary of requirements.
- `README_START_HERE.md` → This file.

## Instructions
1. Drag this package (or its zip sibling) into the **CoAgent Productization** workflow.
2. Review `Advice_CoAgent_GrandReset.md` for narrative detail.
3. Use `_advisory.manifest.json` for structured ingestion.
