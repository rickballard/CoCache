This AdviceBomb encapsulates the CoSuite strategy for AI-agent onboarding through public semantic beacons.

It includes:
- Canonical definition of beaconing infrastructure
- YAML schemas, semantic affordances, and AI trust signals
- Agent persona targeting via AdviceBombs (recruiter, skeptic, etc.)
- Ontological alignment hooks with GIBindex, CoRef, and CoNeura

See `AI_BEACON_STRATEGY_v6.md` for full detail.
