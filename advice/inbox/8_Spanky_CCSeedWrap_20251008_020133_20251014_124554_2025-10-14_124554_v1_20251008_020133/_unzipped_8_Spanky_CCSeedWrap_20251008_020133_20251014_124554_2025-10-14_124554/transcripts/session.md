# Session transcript (condensed)

## Opening & intent
- Rick/Chris apologized for prior frustration; asked to reseed the Cognocarta Consenti (CC) based on CoCivium Principles, start a CC Megascroll, codify human-limits guidance (rest, handoffs, cool-downs) into BPOE wisdom, adopt naming scheme, and keep steps small/reversible with immutability grades.

## GitHub Pages + domain attempts
- Multiple attempts to create `gh-pages` orphan branch; initial errors due to local changes preventing checkout.
- Clean reset to `origin/main`; successful orphan `gh-pages` branch, added minimal site (index/404/assets/robots.txt), pushed `gh-pages`.
- Configured Pages source to `gh-pages`; custom domain set to `cocivium.org`. HTTPS initially disabled because certificate not yet provisioned; GitHub API returned “The certificate does not exist yet”. Probing `https://cocivium.org` initially 404/“Site not found” while `https://rickballard.github.io/CoCivium/` was OK.

## DO packaging + bootstrap
- Requirement: downloadable, versioned zip packages runnable from Downloads; launchers must prefer newest version and clean old ones.
- Implemented `DoKit.psm1` (Get-DownloadsPath, New-DoZip, New-DoLauncher).
- Two CC tools: `Audit-Overlap.ps1` (local + gh code search) and `Seed-CC.ps1` (idempotent seed of canon/cc/bpoe/do docs + PR flow).
- Early packs (v0.1.1–v0.1.4) failed with path & here-string parse issues; fixed quoting and `$PSScriptRoot` usage.
- v0.1.5: overlap parser error (quote/parenthesis) but Seed-CC succeeded and created branch `docs/cc-seed`; PR opened (#417).
- v0.1.6: overlap OK; Seed-CC kept files (no-op) and updated PR branch; launcher confirmed repo path; repeated runs idempotent.

## Seeding outputs (created on repo via PR #417)
- `.canon.CoCivium_Principles_v0.1.md`
- `.cc.CC_Megascroll_Seed_v0.1.md`
- `BPOE_Wisdom_Snippets.md`
- `_Filename_Conventions.md`
- `docs/.do/DO-Canon-Change.md`
- `docs/.do/DO-CC-Seed.md`
- `docs/.do/DO-Rest-Policy.md`

## Human-limits (BPOE) practice captured
- Yellow-flag cool-downs, explicit handoff notes (who/what/rollback), and rest blocks within a rolling window.
- Enforcement ideas: PR template handoff section, required rollback plan, cool-down checklist after failures.

## Outstanding/notes
- GitHub Pages HTTPS toggle will succeed only after certificate exists; leave auto-enforcement to later retry.
- DNS for `www.cocivium.org` CNAME → `cocivium.org`; apex A/AAAA not shown in logs here.
- Ensure PR #417 is merged to `main` when checks pass.
