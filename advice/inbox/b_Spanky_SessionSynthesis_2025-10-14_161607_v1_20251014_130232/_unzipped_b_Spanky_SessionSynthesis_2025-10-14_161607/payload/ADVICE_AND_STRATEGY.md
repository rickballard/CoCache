# Advice & Strategy — Immediate, 2‑Week, and 6‑Week Moves

## Immediate (48–72h)
- **Freeze the interface:** adopt this zip structure and meta files for all new advice bombs.
- **Publish the reusable prompt** (below) to all active sessions to standardize deep‑analysis outputs.
- **Create a single “Alignment README”** in CoCache that explains ingest rules, manifests, and status lines.

## 2 Weeks
- **Wire CoRef:** convert key claims in advice bombs into reference entries; start a credibility matrix.
- **Introduce Congruence Scoring (alpha):** define a basic rubric (coherence, transparency, non‑coercion, reversibility).
- **Vendor Outreach Draft:** position CoAgent as a partner platform.

## 6 Weeks
- **Autonomy Loop Pilots:** constrained CoAgent loops with logged safeguards.
- **Metrics Dashboard (lite):** exposure of ingest rates, congruence deltas, and adoption of alignment playbooks.
