# Session Transcript (Condensed)

**Date:** 2025-10-08 22:50:01 -0400  
**ShortName:** CPDA-CADI

## Key Threads
- Vision: Establish a neutral, anti-capture commons anchored as **CPDA**, evolving to **CoCivium** (Mindshare environment) with *no kings* governance.
- Seed initiative: **CADI** (CoCivium Asteroid Defence Initiative) as a portfolio test case showcasing open models, global coordination, and governance rigor.
- Organizational model: Swiss foundation (legitimacy) + Isle of Man operating shell (practicality), with DAO/mesh governance, rotating **Stewards**, **Contributors**, **Circles**, and time-bound **Mandates**.
- Rationale: Impact-defense needs **years** of lead time; current detection leaves blind spots; governance & trust must be pre-negotiated.
- Deliverables: Two-repo scaffold (cpda, cadi), Pages microsite layout, quadrant/radar headline graphics, constitutional guardrails.

## Pivots & Emphases
- Keep early public posture **innocuous**; avoid regulatory capture; later rename CPDA → **CoCivium** once stable.
- CADI framed as **portfolio seed**; CoPolitic as sibling org (policy best-practices), under a shared commons club.

## What’s Next (hand-off)
- Create `cpda` repo (future `cocivium`) + microsite.
- Create `cadi` repo with specs, models, scenarios.
- Populate graphics (quadrant/radar) and transparency cadence.
