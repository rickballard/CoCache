# CoSuite Multi-Session Summary & Advice Bomb (v0.1) — 20251014_161916

## Essence of this session
- **Gibber/GIB (Gibberlink Interchange Base)**: a minimal, deterministic envelope for AI↔AI communications with evidence, provenance, identity, rights, and explicit versioning. Human-facing glyphs are a *view*, not the source of truth.
- **Front matter mandate**: dual tracks (human-facing rationale, AI/spec-facing precision), with living STATUS and a comparative matrix; avoid eponyms as units (no “Chomsky” metrics).
- **BPOE integration**: deliverables ship as Spanky/CoWrap bundles (transcripts, manifests, checksums); governance with RFCs, ADRs, and conformance classes (C0–C3).
- **Standardization path**: adoption-first; tests + multiple implementers before applying to formal bodies.
- **Cultural guardrails**: playful terms permitted in docs-only; specs stay mercilessly precise.

## Key directions
1. **Lock the GIB v0 core**: envelope schema, JSON-LD context, golden examples, discovery beacon.
2. **Conformance-first**: C0/C1 harness (validation, canonicalization, signatures, JSON↔N‑Quads↔JSON, JSON↔CBOR).
3. **Negotiation primitives**: Offer/Counter/Accept; Dispute/Challenge/Justify with evidence.
4. **Rights & identity**: ODRL policy objects and DID/VC attachments as first-class citizens.
5. **Merge semantics**: type-aware CRDTs for concurrent claims; deterministic conflict outcomes.
6. **Comparative matrix**: continuously benchmark against FIPA ACL/KQML/OpenAPI-MCP/RDF-only pipelines.
7. **Beaconing & discoverability**: `/.well-known/gibber.json` across CoSuite repos to advertise contexts/capabilities.
8. **Audit rendering**: 2D glyphs as audit UI that round-trips to canonical bytes.

## Impact on CoAgent & CoSuite
- **CoAgent**: speak GIB natively for inter-agent negotiation; expose MCP tools behind GIB messages; surface audit glyphs in the right panel.
- **CoCache**: index GIB packets by CID; store STATUS/INTENTIONS/ADRs for lineage; auto-render glyph audit views.
- **CoCore**: register contexts/ontologies; maintain human-facing mappings; publish merge semantics and policy templates.
- **CoModules**: consume rights/policies via ODRL; report provenance with PROV links.
- **Marketing/Outreach**: publish a “Why GIB” explainer + conformance badges.

## Strategies (actionable but non-implementation)
- **Adoption carrot**: ship drop-in transcoders and signer cookbook; make it cheaper to adopt than maintain ad‑hoc JSON.
- **Safety posture**: define EX (exploitability) red‑team scenarios; require evidence channels for any acceptance.
- **Governance**: rotating stewards; compatibility tags (Additive/Soft‑Breaking/Breaking); RFCs must include test vectors & merge rules.
- **BPOE checks**: CI verifies schema/context diffs, golden example canonicalization, glyph renders, and discovery beacon validity.

## Known gaps to hand off
- Finalize JSON-LD context IRIs; enumerate ~50 core predicates.
- Enumerate performatives as enums; specify utility/constraint attachment.
- CRDT merge rules (sets, lists, counters) with examples.
- ODRL default policy template + VC attachment examples.
- Conformance harness skeleton and badges.
