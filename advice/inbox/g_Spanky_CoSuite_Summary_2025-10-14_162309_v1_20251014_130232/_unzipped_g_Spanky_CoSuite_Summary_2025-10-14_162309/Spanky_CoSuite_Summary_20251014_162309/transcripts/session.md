# Session Synthesis — CoSuite (2025-10-14)

This document condenses recent threads across CoAgent, CoCache, CoMarketing/Outreach, InSeed (Capstone), and governance/guardrails work.

## Core Insights
- **Paced outreach beats manifesto:** For academics (e.g., Pybus), lead with *one* audit-able artifact and a bounded, falsifiable ask.
- **Evidence over rhetoric:** Frame risks as **market-structure** (compute/data concentration; SDK/adtech infrastructures) and measure with falsifiable metrics.
- **Guardrails + SDK visibility are the two ‘teeth’:** Transparent decision-path logging and “glass-box” third‑party dataflow surfacing underpin democratic oversight.
- **No-crowns governance:** Keep roles temporary and artifacts public-interest licensed; avoid capture via “no equity, no IP, no authorship” pledge.
- **Advice-bomb standardization:** Ship small, repeatable packs with DO scripts, checklists, and CRM logs so other sessions can ingest quickly.

## Strategic Directions
1) **CoAgent MVP3 focus:** logability spec (hash-chained JSONL), participatory policy slots, vendor-neutral adapters; measure auditability coverage and time-to-trace.
2) **CoMarketing/Outreach:** paced ladder (email → 2-pager + 90s demo → 20-min critique → student studio). InSeed appears only when credible.
3) **InSeed Capstone (pilot):** publish v0.5 page + pledge; accept EOIs; anonymize by default; fund artifacts that make public-interest claims falsifiable.
4) **BPOE hygiene:** pre-send verifier + secrets scan; abort conditions; minimal evidence shelf to prevent credibility bleed.
5) **Repository layout:** stage in **CoCache/AdviceBombs/**, then promote to **CoMarketing/outreach/** when live.

## Implementation Notes (for ingesting sessions)
- Treat this pack as **source of truth** for outreach cadence, guardrails metrics, and Capstone copy blocks.
- Other sessions should copy the checklists and prompts verbatim, then fill in artifact specifics (log lines, SDK tables).
