# Session Transcript (Captured Summary)

Full raw transcript not available to tool. This file summarizes the current user reports and instructions.

## Context
- User reports multiple ChatGPT sessions (including new ones) are **locking up** and perceives **gradual degradation**.
- User provided a **Spanky Request Pack v2.2** and demands a single zip with a strict structure and counts, *no questions*, *no local code execution*.
- Goal: Return the requested archive, mark unfinished items, and include *MISSING_* stubs when source material is not accessible.

## Recent Highlights
- Symptoms: slow or stalled responses across several sessions, including fresh sessions.
- Hypothesis from assistant: session bloat and browser/client constraints are major contributors; repo-as-truth, short-lived sessions preferred.
- Action requested: produce Spanky zip now, following the attached pack's rules.
