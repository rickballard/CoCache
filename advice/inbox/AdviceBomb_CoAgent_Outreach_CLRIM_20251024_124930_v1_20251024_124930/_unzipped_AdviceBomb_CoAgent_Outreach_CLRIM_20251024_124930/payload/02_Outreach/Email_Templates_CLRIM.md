# Clean Email — Addressed to Darren (CLRIM)

Subject: CLRIM pizza lunch — AI & policy volatility (pro bono, tailored)

Darren —
If helpful, I’d be glad to host a one‑hour **pizza lunch** for the CLRIM team on how AI and policy volatility intersect with a boutique like **Campbell, Lee & Ross** — and what a pragmatic 90‑day pivot could look like.

We’ll keep it consistent with CLRIM’s positioning — **“Balance. Protection. Growth.”** and **“Disciplined. Tested. Proven.”** — and frame it around what your clients value: resilient portfolio construction, clear communication, and personalized mandates.

- **Format:** 60 minutes (agenda attached), dot‑vote on 3 near‑term initiatives
- **Scope:** education & playbooks (not investment advice; firm‑level operations focus)
- **Cost:** **pro bono** while InSeed is still in setup (you cover the pizza)
- **Tailoring:** we’ll adapt content for CLRIM’s workflows, team structure, and client profile
- **Deliverables:** a one‑page summary within 24 hours with owners and first deliverables

If that’s of interest, I’ll send two time options and a short, CLRIM‑themed slide draft.

Best,
Rick
