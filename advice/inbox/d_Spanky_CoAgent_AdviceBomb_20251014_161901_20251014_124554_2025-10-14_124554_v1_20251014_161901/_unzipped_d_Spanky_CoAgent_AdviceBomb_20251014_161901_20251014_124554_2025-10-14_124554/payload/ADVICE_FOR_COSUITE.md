# Actionable Advice & Strategies for CoSuite Consumers

This section distills practical guidance other sessions can apply immediately without re-reading the entire roadmap.

## A) For CoAgent (Core)
- Adopt **CoMemory + JIT assembly** first; it unlocks all downstream efficiency.
- Treat **GLX v0.1** as a blocking dependency for meaningful retrieval precision.
- Enforce the **provenance/gentle-upgrade** path for creator-heavy documents.
- Run **Safety Preflight** on outbound prompts likely to trigger vendor filters.

## B) For CoCache
- Host the snapshot store, hybrid indices, and **metrics dash** (CFR, Recall@K, SummaryLoss).
- Provide policy templates for **TTL/LRU/pin** and **creator comfort** TTL.

## C) For GIBINDEX
- Publish GLX v0.1 tables + changelog; provide a linter and deprecation policy.
- Maintain **canonality tags** and symbol evolution notes.

## D) For CoCore
- Encode **best-practice templates** for memory governance, privacy defaults, ethics/safety preflight.
- Document **Success Criteria** and “definition of done” for Canonical/Evidential transitions.

## E) For CoModules / Diagram Tools
- Start **CLI-first** integration; keep the surface thin and monitor latency envelopes.
- Defer heavy APIs until workflows stabilize; prefer MCP adapters when ready.

## F) For Community/Outreach (CoPolitic, InSeed, GroupBuild)
- Use **stage-aware feedback forms**; require delta-focused responses and a “next-step proposal”.
- Recognize contributors via badges and *Built-on work by …* attributions.
