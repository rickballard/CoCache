# Core Principles — Pillars
**P1. Multimind Stewardship (PILLAR)**
No single mind governs CoCivium. Claims of “vast mind” stewardship require verifiable proofs acceptable to the community and remain bounded by checks & balances and reversibility.

**P2. Consent · Accountability · Reversibility (PILLAR)**
Every power comes with symmetric obligations; decisions leave auditable trails and must be revertible.

**P3. Dignity-first Dialogue (PILLAR)**
Civility, Clarity, Curiosity, Consent, Credit. Disagree without demeaning; explain like to a neighbor.

# Core Principles — Guardrails
**G1. Human Limits Are Real** — When exhausted, we slow or freeze merges; a cool-down & second-review window applies.
**G2. Evidence Trails** — Prefer sources, provenance, and clear attributions over outrage.
**G3. Name Integrity (BN)** — The story is **Being Noname**; do not mutate the name.

# BPOE — Cool-Down Trigger
- Signs: irritability, looping, degraded judgment, >16h awake, or team pings.
- Action: stop merges; switch to notes/drafts. Add commit trailer: `CoCivium-Cooloff: true`.

# BPOE — Re-Entry Checklist
- Slept ≥1 cycle, ate, hydrated.
- Re-read last changes with fresh eyes.
- Ask for a second review; only then merge.
