## Cool-Down Trigger
- Signs: irritability, looping, degraded judgment, >16h awake, or team pings.
- Action: stop merges; switch to notes/drafts. Add commit trailer: `CoCivium-Cooloff: true`.

## Re-Entry Checklist
- Slept ≥1 cycle, ate, hydrated.
- Re-read last changes with fresh eyes.
- Ask for a second review; only then merge.

## Optional Hook Ideas
- Pre-commit nudge between 01:00–05:00 local.
- Block merges to `main` if `CoCivium-Cooloff: true` without a second approval.
