# GroupBuild Training Deck (Facilitator Notes)

> 12–15 minutes.  Keep it moving.  Volunteers only need QR + SMS basics.

---
## Slide 1 — Welcome & the 2‑minute promise
- What you’ll get today: faster turnout, safer shifts, less organizer thrash.  
- Pilot is free; you keep your data; no lock‑in.

---
## Slide 2 — Today’s pain
- Missed shifts, unknown headcounts, slow last‑minute changes.  
- Mixed devices/connectivity → need offline + SMS fallback.

---
## Slide 3 — What GroupBuild covers (pilot scope)
- Shift signup/handoff.  
- On‑site headcounts (QR + manual fallback).  
- Broadcast lanes (All‑Hands, Safety/Legal, Per‑Site) with SMS fallback.

---
## Slide 4 — Roles
- **Pilot Owner:** approves messages, watches dashboard, 10–20 min day‑of.  
- **Site Leads:** place posters; 2–4 sweeps/shift; acknowledge broadcasts.  
- **Volunteers:** scan once; opt‑in to SMS (optional).

---
## Slide 5 — Poster + QR flow
- Place at entrance/gather points.  
- Volunteers scan; offline cache works if data is weak.  
- Manual check‑in if needed.

---
## Slide 6 — Broadcast lanes
- **All‑Hands:** schedule, general updates.  
- **Safety/Legal:** route/weather/legal—acks required.  
- **Per‑Site:** fill gaps, shift handoffs.

---
## Slide 7 — Offline + SMS fallback
- Check‑ins cache and sync later.  
- Broadcasts fall back to SMS (opt‑in).

---
## Slide 8 — Privacy & retention
- Minimal data.  Opt‑in.  Export on request.  Auto‑purge ≤30 days.

---
## Slide 9 — Day‑of checklist
- T‑60m test ping; posters up; first sweep T‑15m.  
- Watch coverage alerts; trigger safety lane if needed.

---
## Slide 10 — After‑action & metrics
- Export CSV/JSON; 15‑min retro.  
- KPIs: show‑up delta, coverage, acks, headcount completeness, organizer hours.

**Q&A (10 minutes).**
