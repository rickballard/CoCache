Title: Build Democracyâ€™s Immune System: Join GroupBuild

---

We're building GroupBuild â€” a decentralized, open-source platform to help communities self-organize in defence of Democracy, dignity, and digital privacy.

Think of it as a secure civic stack for protests, petitions, whistleblower protection, and cooperative governance. Anonymous but accountable. Designed for resilience. Built by and for people who still give a damn.

We need your help if you care about:
- Building tech that canâ€™t be hijacked by billionaires or regimes
- Enabling secure protest coordination outside mainstream platforms
- Designing tools that actually protect user anonymity while enabling trust
- Resisting mass manipulation and preserving democratic agency

GroupBuild is open-source, non-commercial, and mission-aligned. No VC. No extraction. Just tools that fight for the people who use them.

We're calling developers, designers, and privacy-aware engineers who want to work on something meaningful. Whether you're a civic hacker, system architect, or crypto-anarchist tinkererâ€”we want you.
