# GroupBuild Pilot — Summary Plan, Strategy & Deliverables (Both Parties)

**Purpose.** Provide a one-page (Discord-ready) summary of the MVP pilot: strategy, scope, objectives/KPIs, timeline, and deliverables for **GroupBuild** and the **Customer**.

---

## 1) Strategy (why this pilot, why now)
- **Wedge:** Day-of operations & resilience (shift coverage, live headcounts, instant alerts with SMS fallback).  
- **Approach:** Run a **2–4 week, no-cost** pilot tied to one real action day; coexist with current stack (CSV/JSON exports).  
- **Targets:** A union local in active action (e.g., CUPE), ACORN chapter, or climate hub (350/Sunrise) to get frequent reps and fast proof.  
- **Promise:** Measurable lift in turnout reliability, coverage, and coordination efficiency without rip-and-replace.

---

## 2) Scope (what’s in / out)
**In:** Shift signup/handoff · On-site headcounts (QR + manual, offline cache) · Broadcast lanes (All-Hands, Safety/Legal, Per-Site) with SMS fallback · CSV/JSON export · Privacy/retention controls (≤30 days by default).  
**Out for now:** Long-term CRM/list mgmt, donations/petitions, deep VAN write-back, advanced rideshare (post-pilot candidates).

---

## 3) Objectives & KPIs (customer selects 3–5 to sign off)
| Objective | KPI (Target) |
|---|---|
| Increase turnout reliability | **+10–25%** show-up delta (Checked-in/Committed vs baseline) |
| Stabilize shift coverage | **≥95%** staffed hours; **0** “dark” sites |
| Faster last-minute comms | **≥90%** delivery in **5m**; **≥60%** acknowledgments in **10m** |
| Safety messaging discipline | ≥**1** safety broadcast; **100%** site-lead acknowledgments |
| Reliable headcounts | **≥85%** participants recorded (QR or manual) |
| Reduce organizer hours | **−25–40%** day-of coordination time vs baseline |
| Data ownership & portability | Export delivered **T+24h**; retention **≤30d**; **0** unresolved issues |

**Baseline:** last comparable action (or 4-week average).

---

## 4) Timeline & milestones
- **T-5 → T-2 days:** Configure console, ingest site list, generate posters, SMS/Signal dry run, offline-cache check.  
- **T-1 day:** 10-minute readiness check; print/place posters.  
- **Day-of:** Test ping (T-60m), first headcount sweep (T-15m), live coverage alerts.  
- **T+24–48h:** Deliver CSV/JSON exports; 15-minute retrospective; case-study draft (optional).

---

## 5) Deliverables & responsibilities (both sides)
| Deliverable | GroupBuild | Customer |
|---|---|---|
| Pilot setup (console, shifts, lanes) | Configure and host | Provide dates, site list, expected turnout |
| Posters (QR + short code) | Provide print-ready PDFs | Print & place at sites |
| Training (12–15 min) | Run live/recorded session + deck | Ensure Pilot Owner + site leads attend |
| Broadcasts (All-Hands / Safety / Per-Site) | Set up & send on instruction | Approve content; identify recipients |
| Offline check-in + manual fallback | Implement & brief | Site leads perform 2–4 sweeps/shift |
| Day-of support | Monitor dashboard; coverage alerts | On-site contact, escalate issues |
| Data export (CSV/JSON) | Deliver T+24h | Receive, verify; request purge/retention |
| Case study (optional) | Draft with metrics | Review/approve or request edits |

**Roles:**  
- **Pilot Owner (Customer):** single accountable lead; approves broadcasts; joins retro.  
- **Site Leads (Customer):** poster placement; headcount sweeps; acks.  
- **GroupBuild PM:** setup, day-of monitoring, exports, case study.

---

## 6) Human effort (estimates)
- **Pilot Owner:** 45–90 min setup; 10–20 min day-of; 10–20 min after-action.  
- **Each Site Lead:** 5 min orientation; 2–3 min per sweep × 2–4 sweeps/shift; <1 min to acknowledge alerts.  
- **Volunteers:** 10–30 seconds to scan QR; manual check-in option.

*Typical 3-site × 2-shift action:* +**60–90 min** structured tasks replacing **2–4 hours** ad-hoc coordination.

---

## 7) Comms, privacy, and terms
- **Cadence:** Email/DM → 48–72h call → event-date demo → day-of ops → retro T+24–48h.  
- **Privacy:** Minimal data, opt-in, export on request, auto-purge ≤30 days.  
- **Terms:** Free during pilot and remains free while trialing/requesting features within pilot scope. No lock-in; you own your data.

---

## 8) Decision gate (post-pilot)
- If **≥3 objectives** hit targets ⇒ recommend light integration and second event.  
- If **<3** hit ⇒ adjust scope (posters placement, sweeps, audience lists) and rerun once.  
- If not a fit ⇒ export data, purge, and end with lessons learned.
