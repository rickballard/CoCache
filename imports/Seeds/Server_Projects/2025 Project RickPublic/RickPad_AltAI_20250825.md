- `draft`: shaped idea, needs refining.  
- `pilot`: running test.  
- `live`: shipped.  
- `READY`: export to GitHub Discussions.

### New Idea Card — Fix the World: The Game [P1]
```card-md
---
title: Fix the World: The Game
date: 2025-08-25
persona: outreach
domain: public-records
status: draft
---
**Lead.** Design a game that teaches youth civic architecture by remixing A/B proposals, edited for real-world civic benefit.

**Context.** Most humans need scaffolds (strawmen) to ideate well. We can model A/B switching as a gameplay mechanic.

**Proposal.**
- Free game, donation-based on App Stores.
- Main mechanic: players evaluate and edit proposals (choose A or B, improve B, etc.)
- Levels: unlock higher titles (see CivArk)
- Clear Mode (for adults) links to CoModules tools (e.g., CoAgent).

**Risks.** Requires staged onboarding. Political bias must be avoided.

**Dependencies.** Alt README, A/B UI engine, CoModules pipeline.

**Ask.** Draft micro-design doc + MVP scope for adult/teen split.

### New Idea Card — CivArk Title Progression [P2]
```card-md
---
title: CivArk Title Levels
date: 2025-08-25
persona: product
domain: civic-education
status: draft
---
**Lead.** Incentivize gameplay in Fix the World: The Game via leveling system based on civic contributions.

**Context.** Teens need clear, positive reinforcement. Titles like "CivArch" and "CivArk" represent their civic evolution.

**Proposal.**
- Titles: CivSeed → CivScribe → CivArch → CivArk
- Unlock based on task quality and depth of improvement.
- Tie into CoCivium repo via explainers.

**Risks.** Overjustification effect (gamification eclipses real learning).

**Dependencies.** Game engine, switching logic, badge pipeline.

**Ask.** Finalize title list and thresholds.
```

### New Idea Card — A/B Switching as Preference Signal [P1]
```card-md
---
title: A/B Doc Switcher
persona: product
status: pilot
---
**Lead.** Readers toggle between CURRENT vs PROPOSED sections. What they leave visible acts as implicit vote.

**Context.** Document co-evolution needs feedback loops. This is the civic architecture game mechanic.

**Proposal.**
- Use inline toggle elements (JS) on GitHub Pages.
- Track session preference (optional).
- Structure: `<!-- AB:A -->...<!-- AB:B -->...` with toggler logic.

**Risks.** Overload/confusion without style discipline.

**Dependencies.** Alt README, switcher library.

**Ask.** Build scaffold + preview in alt-readme-ai branch.
```

### New Idea Card — Dual README Authoring [P1]
```card-md
---
title: Dual README Strategy
persona: core
status: live
---
**Lead.** Maintain two top-level README versions: Rick’s canonical, and Assistant’s alt (in alt-readme-ai branch).

**Context.** Enables experimentation with vision framing, onboarding tone, and top-down messaging. Readers toggle between A/B to find preferred entry point.

**Proposal.**
- Assistant drafts alternate README.md, submits via PR to `alt-readme-ai`.
- Readers switch via link toggle at top.
- Rick’s version remains canonical.

**Risks.** User confusion; version drift.

**Dependencies.** A/B toggler; decision log markers.

**Ask.** Approve toggle mechanism; allow alt branch to persist.
```

### New Idea Card — InSeed Founder Profile [P3]
```card-md
---
title: InSeed Founder Visibility
date: 2025-08-25
persona: outreach
status: draft
---
**Lead.** Strengthen Rick’s visibility as founder of CoCivium and InSeed via aligned profile.

**Context.** InSeed.com offers consulting/support for orgs adopting CoCivium-aligned practices.

**Proposal.**
- Build minimal site at InSeed.com
- Position Rick as ethical founder, stewarding consent-first infrastructure.
- Maintain note that future governance may reframe or override Rick’s early framing.

**Risks.** Perception of bias or overcentralization.

**Dependencies.** CoCivium README, badge + awards ecosystem.

**Ask.** Draft minimal founder card for outreach reuse.
