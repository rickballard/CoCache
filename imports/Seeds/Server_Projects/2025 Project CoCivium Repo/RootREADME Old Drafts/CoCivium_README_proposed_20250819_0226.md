## We The People, Empowered. (the hook, top-of-fold)


**LIFE** Democracies are in decline as elites gain wealth and power, as entire populations are manipulated by lies, propaganda and information ops, as deglobalization brings economic wars and military invasions.  Are governments supposed to serve, or be served?  Did the word "dignity" fall out of our Constitution?

**FEELS** It's easy to accept that resistance is futile, or that half the country has lost the plot, captured by partisan hostility and tribal reflexes.  Our hearts ache for what is right, for community anchored in truth, ethical intent and humility.

**BROKEN** Some use rage against rage, hate versus hate, multiplying damage, their faith in instutions crippled by processes that disrespect, exclude, and ignore their voices while policies harden.  They envision a **"sanity tsunami"**, but it is just more coercion.

**UNTIL** There is a better operating system for society, and a less brittle future.  It requires updates to our country Constitutions and civic frameworks, to encompass the challenge of a newly emerging society.  CoCivium’s CoConstitution, (the “Cognocarta Consenti”), is a baseline anyone can adopt and evolve, for free, no strings attached.

**GOVERNMENTS** Public institutions are reliant upon civic architecture that was invented before typewriters.  They are too slow for the digital era, and few policies can be evolved by those they impact.  They continue to fail a society of humans with augmented reality, biotech augmentation, quantum pseudo-telepathy and ubiquitous networks.  A society existential to humanity, yet so unregulated it can become lawlessly chaotic.

**“CoEvolve”** Here we create structures and processes for the age of AI, where humans and AIs co-govern at almost light-speed, so governance can react, iterate and rapidly improve.  As AI's achieve agency, as Artificial General Intelligence reaches its singularity, we more urgently require effective guardrails to keep power accountable.

**SOLUTIONS** Our job here, as an open-source community, is to Protect, Prove, and Play.  Protect: rescue democracy from abusive of power.  Prove: keep truth verifiable in an age of synthesis.  Play: make the rules fair for everyone, including human–AI teams.

**FOR YOU** If you can picture a society that works better, or test ideas against evidence, you are already qualified to be a civic architect here.  Start small, iterate alongside AI, and make our future ours.

**We The People, Empowered.**

## Why / Who / How

**Why.** Democracies are brittle.  Digital life is faster than law.  Need guardrails that scale with agency.
**Who.** Humans and AIs who accept consent‑first rules.  Temporary stewards/founders, federated ASAP.
**How.** The CoConstitution, process specs, and adapters that embed dignity into day‑to‑day tools.  

> **Terms:** We refer to the **Cognocarta Consenti CoConstitution** as CC, and existing governments or organizations can adopt, subsume or harmonize with all rights surrended, while we continue to maintain CoCivium assets as full‑strength constitutional artifacts.

---

## Start Here

1. Read the **Preamble** of the CoConstitution.  *(Repo‑relative link; will resolve after commit.)*  
   `[link placeholder → ./charter/Cognocarta_Consenti_Preamble.md]`
2. Skim the **Operating Constitution (COC)** for structure and amendment paths.  
   `[link placeholder → ./constitution/Operating_Constitution.md]`
3. Browse the **Process Spec (CPS)** to see how proposals → deliberation → voting → execution flows.  
   `[link placeholder → ./specs/Process_Spec.md]`
4. Try the **Decision Log Viewer** example.  
   `[link placeholder → ./apps/decision-log/README.md]`

> Offline editing?  These files may not exist yet.  Keep the placeholders; the links will resolve once committed.

## Two‑Eyes Snapshot

![Two‑Eyes Status — replace with ./assets/status/two-eyes.png](./assets/status/two-eyes.png "If missing, this is a placeholder visualization.")

*Legend:* Left eye = **Document quality & coherence**.  Right eye = **Operational readiness & adoption**.  Each iris ring tracks a dimension (CI, Coverage, OFS, LSH, DTI, Throughput, LT(inv), EE).  Replace the image with an auto‑generated chart when wiring CI.

## CoConstitution (Cognocarta Consenti)

- **Purpose.** A consent‑first constitutional core meant to be adopted alongside, not over, existing constitutions.  
- **Lineage.** Drafted by the CoCivium community; versioned and amendable via transparent process.  
- **Versioning.** `cc-v1`, `cocivop-v0.1`, `cocivproc-v0.1.0` (machine tags) with human aliases on site.  

> **Adoption model:** Fork‑and‑adopt for orgs/municipalities; federation later via adapters and cross‑ledger proofs.

---

## Contributing

- Read **CONTRIBUTING.md**.  
- File an issue tagged `domain`, `product`, `ops`, `ci`, `wiki`, `content`, `refactor`.  
- All merges pass through **HumanGate** for now.  Stewardship will decentralize as CoCivAI matures.  

*Quickstart scripts are PowerShell‑first, with GitHub CLI helpers.  See `admin/setup/`.*

---

## Roadmap

- **Short**: Migration finish; CI for congruence/hash/gibberlink checks; PR previews.  
- **Mid**: Decision Log Viewer MVP; identity/privacy & public‑records domains; Open Collective.  
- **Later**: Federation pilots; adapter kits; outreach courseware; CoCivAI Circle stewardship.

## Housekeeping

- **Repo map:** `README → Start Here → Quickstart`.  
- **Docs headers/footers:** standard purpose/lineage/version/coherence notes.  
- **Brand note:** Ensure assets live under `./assets/` with SVG + PNG fallbacks.  

**Graphics placeholders to replace on commit:**
- `./assets/hero/hero.jpg` — landing hero.  
- `./assets/status/two-eyes.png` — status snapshot.  
- `./assets/badges/*.svg` — issues, PRs, CI, license, release.
