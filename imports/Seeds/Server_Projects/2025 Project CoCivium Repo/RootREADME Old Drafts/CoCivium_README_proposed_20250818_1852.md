## What is CoCivium? (the hook, top-of-fold)

**LIFE:** ruled by elites as democracies decline in the face of wars used coerce entire populations...  Aren't governments supposed to serve us, instead of themselves?  Were our country's founders naive to hope that everyone could be treated with dignity and respect?

**FEELS:** sometimes we feel like resistance is futile, and sometimes we feel like half the population has lost its f‑ing mind, captured by media brainwashing and tribal politics to sit back as society regresses back into the stone age!  Who among us is standing up for what is right?

**BROKEN:** we can resist, using anger against anger, hate against hate, but that usually breaks more than it heals.  Or we can gently compromise and realign, respectfully, inclusively, congruently, the way our founders intended.  But for such cooperation to work, despite the broken faith in each other, we need that cooperation to work fast, with everyone heard, like a “sanity tsunami”.

**UNTIL:** we build a better Operating System for Digital Society, our futures are in jeopardy.  Perhaps we need to upgrade our country Constitutions, to fit the emerging challenges.  Perhaps we need to incorporate the tools and systems being developed by this CoCivium community, or its CoConstitution (the “Cognocarta Consenti”).  Perhaps such things could be free for all to use and evolve, because perhaps we care enough about everyone's future, to make it so.

**GOVERNMENTS:** are struggling.  Their governance policies are buried in an almost static “civic architecture” that is hard to repair, let alone improve.  Old‑world civic architects could not have designed our politics or governance for a digital society, enabled by biotech upgrades to our brains, augmented reality that shows evidence‑based truth, or pervasive networking that connects everyone, everywhere.  But we can.

**“CoEvolve”:** government structures and processes, for the age of artificial intelligence (AI) and their parallel societies, all of us self‑governing at near light‑speed.  AI's future society is an inevitability we call CoCivAI, but many technology experts refer to it as “agency“, or “AGI”, or “the singularity”, often without knowning what these things mean for our societies, or how they should be governed.

**SOLUTIONS:** typically involve using special‑purpose AI's, like a team of genius servants, human/AI teams that can build a digital empire in minutes, where before it would have taken lifetimes.  Our challenge here, as an open source community (CoCivium.org), is to figure out how to: (a) guardrail against AI's that are sometimes controlled by bad actors, (b) keep society honest when alternative realities can be fabricated, and (c) make future society fair for all Beings, even for hybrid human/AI, and perhaps even for those who watch us from beyond as they wait to end their quarantine of our collective potential.

**FOR YOU:** as someone who can imagine what future society aught to look like, as someone who can help us figure out how democracies might recover, or how our own local municipality might improve its policies...  You, with all due respect, are already qualified to be a civic architect for CoCivium.

**We The People, Empowered.**

**LIFE:** Democracies stagnate while wars and information ops coerce entire populations. Governments are meant to serve the governed, not themselves.  The founders weren’t naive; they expected us to keep improving the machinery of consent.

**FEELS:** Sometimes resistance feels futile; sometimes it feels like half the country has lost the plot, captured by propaganda and tribal reflexes.  Our hearts ache for what is right, for community anchored in truth, ethical intent and humility.

**BROKEN:** We can use rage against rage, and hate against hate, but this multiplies damage.  Instead we can develop processes that are respectful and inclusive, so everyone is heard before policies harden; a **"sanity tsunami"**.

**UNTIL:** There is a better operating system for digital society, and a less brittle future.  It requires updates to our country Constitutions and civic retooling to meet emerging challenges.  CoCivium’s CoConstitution (the “Cognocarta Consenti”) is a baseline anyone can adopt, and evolve.

**GOVERNMENTS:** Public institutions, trapped in legacy civic architecture, are hard to upgrade.  They were never built for humans in augmented reality, with biotech augmentation, or quantum pseudo-telepathy through ubiquitous networks.  That society is now arriving, unregulated.

**“CoEvolve”:** Create structures and processes for the age of AI, where humans and AIs co-govern at almost light-speed.  As AI's achieve agency, as AGI reaches the singularity, we can all help to evolve the guardrails that keep power accountable.

**SOLUTIONS:** Purpose-built AI-systems can be used as transparent tools, by us and by unelected rulers.  Our job as an open-source community is to: (a) rescue democracy from hostile rulers, (b) preserve evidentiary truth amid synthetic fabrication, and, (c) make the rules fair for all, including human–AI teams.

**FOR YOU:** If you can picture a society that works better, or test ideas against evidence, you are already qualified to be a civic architect here.  Start small, iterate alongside AI, and make our future ours.

## 30‑second Why / Who / How

**Why.** Democracies are brittle.  Digital life is faster than law.  We need guardrails that scale with agency.  
**Who.** People and AIs who consent to consent‑first rules.  Stewards today, federated tomorrow.  
**How.** A CoConstitution, process specs, and adapters that embed dignity into day‑to‑day tools.  

> **Term note:** We intentionally call the CC a **CoConstitution** to ease adoption by existing governments and orgs while keeping it full‑strength as a constitutional artifact.

---

## Start Here

1. Read the **Preamble** of the CoConstitution.  *(Repo‑relative link; will resolve after commit.)*  
   `[link placeholder → ./charter/Cognocarta_Consenti_Preamble.md]`
2. Skim the **Operating Constitution (COC)** for structure and amendment paths.  
   `[link placeholder → ./constitution/Operating_Constitution.md]`
3. Browse the **Process Spec (CPS)** to see how proposals → deliberation → voting → execution flows.  
   `[link placeholder → ./specs/Process_Spec.md]`
4. Try the **Decision Log Viewer** example.  
   `[link placeholder → ./apps/decision-log/README.md]`

## Two‑Eyes Snapshot

![Two‑Eyes Status — replace with ./assets/status/two-eyes.png](./assets/status/two-eyes.png "If missing, this is a placeholder visualization.")

*Legend:* Left eye = **Document quality & coherence**.  Right eye = **Operational readiness & adoption**.  Each iris ring tracks a dimension (CI, Coverage, OFS, LSH, DTI, Throughput, LT(inv), EE).  Replace the image with an auto‑generated chart when wiring CI.

---

## CoConstitution (Cognocarta Consenti)

- **Purpose.** A consent‑first constitutional core meant to be adopted alongside, not over, existing constitutions.  
- **Lineage.** Drafted by the CoCivium community; versioned and amendable via transparent process.  
- **Versioning.** `cc-v1`, `cocivop-v0.1`, `cocivproc-v0.1.0` (machine tags) with human aliases on site.  

> **Adoption model:** Fork‑and‑adopt for orgs/municipalities; federation later via adapters and cross‑ledger proofs.

---

## Contributing

- Read **CONTRIBUTING.md**.  
- File an issue tagged `domain`, `product`, `ops`, `ci`, `wiki`, `content`, `refactor`.  
- All merges pass through **HumanGate** for now.  Stewardship will decentralize as CoCivAI matures.  

*Quickstart scripts are PowerShell‑first, with GitHub CLI helpers.  See `admin/setup/`.*

---

## Roadmap

- **Short**: Migration finish; CI for congruence/hash/gibberlink checks; PR previews.  
- **Mid**: Decision Log Viewer MVP; identity/privacy & public‑records domains; Open Collective.  
- **Later**: Federation pilots; adapter kits; outreach courseware; CoCivAI Circle stewardship.
