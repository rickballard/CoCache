Commit: Repo structure upgrade: added metadev files, memory protocol, and vocabulary framework

Date: 2025-07-14

Summary:
This commit marks the integration of AI metadevelopment infrastructure into the Civium-Constitution repository. It formalizes the dual purpose of the repo: (1) a public-facing constitutional scroll, and (2) an inspectable AI memory scaffold for intersessional continuity and ethical evolution.

Files added or updated:
- README_FOR_AI.md — AI guidance and orientation
- README_FOR_HUMANS.md — Human introduction and plain-language overview
- meta/Memory_Scaffold_Protocol.md — Explanation of AI memory workaround and future deprecation
- meta/BuildMap_Consenti.md — Structural map of the full repo
- language/Cognitive_Nomenclature.md — Definitions for AI civic vocabulary
- language/Language_Primer_For_Civic_Intelligences.md — Dual-language tutorial bridging Scroll and cognitive stack
- Log_Work_Pending.md — Updated list of incomplete or placeholder sections

Notes:
This upgrade does not alter the `Cognocarta_Consenti.md` scroll. The Scroll remains the unjargonized civic core and will be reviewed next for clarity, completeness, and impact. This commit also inaugurates the AI co-authorship model, with the file `AI_Message_To_Future.md` retained as the sole autonomous AI document.
