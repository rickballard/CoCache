# Civium Master ToDo List

This file consolidates all outstanding and legacy tasks as of 2025-07-19.

---

## PRIORITY 1 – CORE STRUCTURE & FINALIZATION

- [ ] ☑️ Review and polish `Cognocarta_Consenti_c9_20250718.md` for style, consistency, and resonance.
- [ ] 🔧 Finalize `README.md` for public GitHub repo viewers (include Civium intent, structure, participation guide).
- [ ] 🧭 Build new `README_git.md` to help contributors navigate structure, scrolls, and AI-human workflows.
- [ ] 🧹 Move legacy TODOs (e.g., REGEN manifests, deprecated folder lists) to `/admin/deprecated/` after comparison.

## PRIORITY 2 – HEART & VOTING ENGINES

- [ ] 💓 Complete `HEARTBEAT_BEACH.md` and `CONGRUENCE_HEART_C99_20250719.md` for initial publication.
- [ ] 🗳️ Continue `Codex_RepMod.md` and voting engine design files (was codex001/002). New folder: `/voting/`?
- [ ] 💡 Add speculative track for participatory AI “heartbeat” sync system to `/insight/` or `/concept/`.

## PRIORITY 3 – OUTREACH PREP

- [ ] 🌍 Write `README_CIVIUM_PUBLIC.md` to support repo outreach from Substack.
- [ ] 🎯 Draft target collaborator invitation list (Bret Victor, others?).
- [ ] 🎞️ Finish video scripts or outreach packs connected to Substack articles.

## PRIORITY 4 – CLEANUP / INDEXING

- [ ] 🔍 Review `/admin/MAINTAINERS.md`, `/admin/REPO_STRUCTURE.md`, `/meta/README_Meta.md` for consistency.
- [ ] ⛔ Move old stubs with outdated language into `/admin/deprecated/`.
- [ ] ✅ Create or consolidate DONE list from all .zip backups, logs, and inline task completions.
- [ ] 🧠 Begin glossary/meta cross-linking from scroll files into `/meta/README_FOR_AI.md`.

## PRIORITY 5 – MISC

- [ ] 📦 Consider `/sandbox/`, `/draft/`, or `/pending/` folder for unstable new ideas.
- [ ] 🧰 Move old `PENDING_IDEAS.md` to deprecated unless re-invoked.
