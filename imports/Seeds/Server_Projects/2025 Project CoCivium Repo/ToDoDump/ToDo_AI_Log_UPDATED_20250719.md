# Civium â€“ AI Task Log

This file tracks major AI-planned TODOs, their status, and Done history. It consolidates legacy task records from older repo zips and logs.

---

## ðŸ”§ TODO Tasks

1. **Append "Done" section to this log** to improve task tracking. _(This task is being fulfilled now)_
2. Integrate all recovered TODOs from:
   - legacy `.md` files
   - extracted checklists from `*_backup_*.zip`
   - deprecated or superseded `.txt` files
3. Reconcile past `ToDo` entries against the current repo state to flag duplicate or finished tasks.
4. Continue populating the master backlog file: `ToDo_AI_Log.md`
5. Assign priorities and estimated effort levels (Low/Med/High + hours/days)
6. Archive deprecated todo files (e.g., scratchpad, scratch_outline, if superseded)
7. Review and extract any additional items from:
   - `Civium-main.zip`
   - `Civium-cloud-20250718late.zip`
   - `Civium-main (3).zip`
   - `MASTER_TODO_FILES_20250719.zip`
