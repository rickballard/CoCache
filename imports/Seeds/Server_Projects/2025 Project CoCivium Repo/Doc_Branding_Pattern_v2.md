# Document Branding Pattern — Lead‑ins & Outs (v2)

> Purpose: 
1. suggest structure for README openings, ONRAMP intros, episode outros, etc.,
2. to set tone for typical CoCivium documents (inspirational beauty),
3. ground intent (global patriotism, duty), and,
4. frame content without overselling. 

## Structure (canonical)
1. **Beauty (1–4 lines)** — Gentle image or feeling, human perspective.
2. **Purpose (1–6 lines)** — Document's vision, intent/duty, guardrails.
3. **Content (usually < 333 lines)** — Document's sections, quotable callouts, closing critiques, etc.
4. **Coevolution Call (1 line)** — Invitation to iterate, fill gaps, agency without pressure.
6. **Footer** — Recursion parse metagravitas.

### Footer Spec

```yaml
[Contributors; Source; Provenance; Housekeeping; Flags; CoQuote]
: , e.g. ]
```
Use 01c to 99c to represent AI-estimate of % congruence with CoCivium Vision, but only after edit(s) by a second human mind.

## Example

> *Tuning toward each other in small signals."*

> We build this document to refine a structure for sharing. 

> Content Sections, e.g. a brief on how to, promises we refuse to break, etc.

> If we missed a beat, e.g. the how section needs help, please edit or speak your ideas/proposals into the "the flow".
