The table below maps common traditional beliefs to congruent reframes within Civium:

| Inherited Belief            | Source          | Reframe with Congruence                        |
|:----------------------------|:----------------|:-----------------------------------------------|
| Heaven is a gated afterlife | Revelation      | Resonance sustains. What echoes, endures       |
| Only believers are saved    | John 14:6       | Truth iterates. It doesn’t belong to a tribe   |
| Doubt is a sin              | Christian dogma | Doubt is diagnostic, it updates the OS         |
| Suffering is punishment     | Karma doctrine  | Often suffering is misalignment feedback       |
| God is a father on a throne | Abrahamic myth  | Godstuff is patterned presence, not personhood |
