**Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario – Form 1 (Draft)**
Application Under Section 34 – Discrimination in Services (Education)

Complainants:
Christine Ballard and Richard Ballard, on behalf of their minor son, Nicholas Ballard

Respondents:
1. Halton Catholic District School Board (HCDSB)
2. Principal Penny Uniacke, in her professional capacity
3. Superintendent Laura Dinolfo, in her professional capacity
4. (Optional) Trustee Helena Karabela, in her governance capacity

Ground of Discrimination: Disability (neurodivergence including ADHD, anxiety, and executive functioning disorder)

Date(s) of Discrimination: September 2024 – Present (Ongoing)

1. What Happened?

Nicholas Ballard, a neurodivergent student with a formal Individual Education Plan (IEP), has faced ongoing discrimination at his school due to the failure of the Halton Catholic District School Board to provide required accommodations. Despite clear medical and educational documentation, Nicholas’s learning needs have not been met, resulting in academic setbacks and emotional harm.

Specific issues include:
- Refusal to allow classroom reassignment despite Nicholas’s deteriorating condition.
- Denial of requests for policy documentation used to justify such refusal.
- A blanket policy by the Principal against any class reassignment, in direct contradiction to individualized accommodation requirements.
- A communication ban limiting Nicholas’s parents to one email per week.
- Failure to implement IEP-required supports such as written checklists, timelines, and visual cues.
- An incident where Nicholas hid in his locker due to feeling emotionally unsafe, with delayed school response.

These failures represent a sustained and systemic denial of reasonable accommodation.

2. Why Is This Discrimination?

Section 1 of the Ontario Human Rights Code guarantees the right to equal treatment in services, including education, without discrimination based on disability.

- The respondents failed to accommodate Nicholas to the point of undue hardship.
- The school applied rigid policies (e.g., blanket denial of reassignment) instead of individualized planning.
- The respondents ignored parental consent to receive and act on Nicholas’s private information.
- The school board’s actions and inactions created an unsafe and discriminatory environment.

3. What Do You Want the Tribunal to Do?

- Direct the Board to reassign Nicholas to a more suitable classroom immediately.
- Mandate a full review of HCDSB’s classroom assignment and IEP enforcement policies.
- Require human rights training for the involved staff.
- Order an apology letter to Nicholas and his family.
- Provide monetary compensation for injury to dignity and emotional harm (to be determined).
- Recommend oversight from the Ministry of Education if systemic non-compliance is found.

4. Supporting Documents and Witnesses

- Nicholas’s IEP
- Emails and records of communications with school staff and Trustee
- Medical/educational evaluations (with consent)
- Witnesses: Christine Ballard, Richard Ballard, school CYC (Mrs. Baxter), and possibly Nicholas (if age-appropriate)
