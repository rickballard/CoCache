**TEMPLATE LETTER – Outreach to Parents for Multi-Family Legal Action**

Subject: Invitation to Join Legal Advocacy for Neurodivergent Student Rights in HCDSB

Dear [Parent's Name],

I am reaching out to you as a fellow parent within the Halton Catholic District School Board (HCDSB) whose child has struggled to receive proper educational support and accommodation for neurodivergent needs.

After nearly a year of unsuccessful attempts to resolve serious and ongoing issues regarding the accommodation of our son, Nicholas, we are initiating formal proceedings with the Ontario Human Rights Tribunal and preparing the groundwork for a broader legal action that may include multiple families. Our situation involves:

- Repeated non-compliance with Nicholas’s IEP
- Denial of classroom reassignment despite well-documented distress
- Blanket policies contradicting the duty to accommodate
- Restrictive communication and transparency issues
- Emotional and psychological harm caused by systemic failures

If your family has experienced similar barriers—such as a lack of classroom flexibility, failure to implement IEPs, or discriminatory treatment related to neurodivergence—we invite you to connect with us.

We are currently working with human rights legal advisors and exploring a class action suit to seek not only remedy but also systemic change within HCDSB.

If you are interested in sharing your story confidentially or would like to learn more about joining the legal action, please contact us directly:

Christine Ballard: christine@ballardassociates.com
Richard Ballard: rballard@inseed.com

All correspondence will be handled with sensitivity and full respect for your privacy and consent.

Together, we may be able to drive meaningful accountability and reform—so that no student is left unsupported, and no parent silenced for advocating on their behalf.

With solidarity,
Christine and Richard Ballard
