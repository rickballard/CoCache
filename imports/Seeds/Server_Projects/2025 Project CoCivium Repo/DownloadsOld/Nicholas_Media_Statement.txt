Subject: Halton Catholic School Board Fails to Accommodate Neurodivergent Student – Parents Pursue Human Rights Action
Date: June 8, 2025

Christine and Richard Ballard have initiated formal proceedings against the Halton Catholic District School Board (HCDSB) after nearly a year of documented failure to accommodate their son Nicholas, a Grade 4 student with diagnosed neurodivergence, including ADHD and executive functioning challenges.

Despite having an Individual Education Plan (IEP) that outlines critical supports for learning and emotional regulation, Nicholas has been repeatedly denied access to the accommodations required for his success. These include written instructions, classroom-based planning tools, and structured communication practices. Moreover, the family has been refused a simple classroom reassignment to a more appropriate setting—despite documentation showing that Nicholas’s current environment is contributing to heightened anxiety and emotional distress.

The Board’s Principal has stated she has "never allowed" a student to transfer between classrooms in her tenure—raising serious concerns about compliance with provincial policy, which mandates individualized accommodation. Additionally, the family has faced obstacles to communication, including a formal restriction limiting them to one email per week and the school’s refusal to schedule meetings.

After exhausting internal remedies—including meetings with the Principal, Superintendent, and Trustee Helena Karabela—without resolution, the Ballards are preparing a formal complaint to the Ontario Human Rights Tribunal and exploring a multi-family legal action.

"This isn’t just about our child. It’s about a system that resists change, prioritizes optics, and punishes parents who advocate," said Christine Ballard. "No student should be put in emotional harm's way simply for needing help."

The family is now urging other parents with similar experiences within HCDSB to come forward. A coordinated legal and public action may be the only path to meaningful reform.
