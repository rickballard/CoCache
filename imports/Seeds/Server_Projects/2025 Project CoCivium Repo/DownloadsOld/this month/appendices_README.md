# Appendices Folder

This folder contains simulation rules, civic infrastructure specs, and optional governance extensions.

Unlike codices (which are normative), appendices are descriptive and operational. They describe algorithms, AI requirements, moderation protocols, or civic tools that support Civium in practice.
