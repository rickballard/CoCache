README.txt â€” Technical Overview for GroupBuild Contributors

---

Welcome to the GroupBuild project.

This is a civic tech platform designed to help communities self-organize, resist manipulation, and coordinate public action securely.

ðŸ”§ Tech Goals
- Accountable anonymity (via pseudonymous IDs + trust tagging)
- Encrypted group coordination (e.g. event planning, voting)
- Ethical AI moderation (BeAxa stack: flagging, context scoring)
- Decentralized and federated design (resilience first)
- Interoperable with Matrix, ActivityPub, and privacy-first tools

ðŸ§± Stack (MVP phase)
- Frontend: React / TypeScript (Alt: Svelte welcome)
- Backend: Node.js or Rust (open to Go)
- Auth: Temporary IDs, optional zk-SNARKs for pseudonym proofs
- Storage: IPFS, Postgres, or hybrid (negotiable)
- AI moderation: OpenAI APIs + shadow-model cross-checking
- Deployment: Docker / DigitalOcean / Self-hosted

ðŸ“Œ Contributions Wanted
- UI/UX engineers for protest/event builder and anonymous chat
- Backend devs for pseudonymous identity and voting system
- Security experts for trust scoring, zero-knowledge proofs
- Ethical AI engineers for moderation logic and fallback alerts
- DevOps for lightweight hosting, network self-replication
