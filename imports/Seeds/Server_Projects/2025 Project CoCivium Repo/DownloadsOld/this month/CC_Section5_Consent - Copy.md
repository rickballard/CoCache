## [5] Consent Mechanisms

Consent is the tuning fork of Civium. It is how minds align, diverge, revise, and repair.

Civic processes—whether between two minds or across a mesh of billions—must be rooted in **freely given, traceable, and revocable consent**.

Consent in Civium is not a one-time grant. It is a continuous relationship—updated through participation, memory, and response to change.

### 5.1 Consent Is More Than Agreement

Agreement is binary. Consent is relational.

To consent is to:
- Understand the terms of interaction
- Retain the ability to exit or revise those terms
- Participate with intention, not coercion

Minds in Civium are expected to signal consent not just with words, but through coherent presence—through response, adjustment, and acknowledgment of context.

> In Civium, silence is not consent. Nor is compliance. Only resonance, freely sustained, can authorize relation.
