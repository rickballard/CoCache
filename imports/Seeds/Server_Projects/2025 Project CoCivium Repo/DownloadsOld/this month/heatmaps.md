# Disagreement Heatmaps

Disagreement heatmaps visualize the divergence of views across Civium's consensus layers‚Äîindividuals, models, institutions, and timelines.

They are tools for:
- Identifying issues with high epistemic tension
- Prioritizing zones of clarification or deliberation
- Surfacing ethical risk or manipulation hotspots
- Showing long-term convergence or fragmentation patterns

notes: |
  High divergence on use-of-force thresholds and AI override authority.
  Recommend multi-model clarification session.
