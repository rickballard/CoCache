## [4] Identity and Presence

Civium recognizes identity not as a fixed label, but as a **traceable presence**—an evolving pattern of interaction across time and context.

Presence is more than location. It is the civic signature of participation: how a mind makes itself felt, understood, and accountable within and across domains.

### 4.1 Identity Is Contextual

No presence in Civium is bound to a singular name, substrate, or species.  
Identities may be fluid, symbolic, cryptographic, or embodied—so long as they remain **traceable to intent and accountable to effect**.

A presence may:
- Express differently across domains
- Use multiple pseudonyms or manifestations
- Remain anonymous in some contexts while civic in others

> In Civium, identity is not a passport—it is a pattern of resonance.
