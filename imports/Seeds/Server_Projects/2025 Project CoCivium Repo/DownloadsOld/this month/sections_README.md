# Sections Folder

This folder contains Civiumâ€™s constitutional core:

- `axioms.md`: Foundational premises
- `rights.md`: Guaranteed entitlements within Civium
- `powers.md`: Institutional and AI constraints
- `governance.md`: Operational systems and protocols

These define the minimum viable Civium framework. All codices must remain compatible with these unless explicitly flagged as divergence proposals.
