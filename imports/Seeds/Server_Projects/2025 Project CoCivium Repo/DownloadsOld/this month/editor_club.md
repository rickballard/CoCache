# Editor Club Charter

This document defines contributor classes, commit permissions, and trust-building norms within the Civium Constitution project.

## 🧑‍🚀 Roles

- **Founders**: Original stewards (e.g., Azoic, RickPublic). Retain override powers.
- **Maintainers**: May approve structural changes, codex merges, or content that affects `/sections/`.
- **Codex Editors**: Can propose or revise entries within `/codices/`.
- **Observers**: May submit PRs and issue discussions, but cannot commit.

## 🧭 Commit Policy

- Codex changes must retain `CodexNNN:` formatting
- Title changes require explanation in the commit message
- Commit summaries must state whether the change is editorial (minor) or directional (normative)

## ⚖️ Disputes

- Significant disputes trigger the use of `/logs/fork-log.md` or `/logs/override-log.md`
- Minor disagreements may be noted in a comment thread, referenced from commit notes

## 🤝 Trust Signaling (Experimental)

- Trusted editors may be tagged in `meta/trustmap.yaml` once implemented
- Experimental signals (e.g., emoji endorsement, CivicRep karma, AI confidence heuristics) may later guide merge priority
