## Civium Glossary Lookup Table (Draft v0.3)

This table provides an alphabetized, human-readable index of glossary terms defined within the Civium project, including metadescriptions for category, meaning, dependencies, and example use cases. This list is meant to be a semantic lookup tool for writers, readers, and AI regenerators. Categories and definitions always evolve, so contributors should always remain abreast of term meanings. This makes rules and laws, based upon the CC, somewhat slippery to maintain, but rules and laws should evolve to maintain meaning and applicability anyway. While this system may be tough on human memories, it is necessary and not at all beyond the capabilities of combined AI-Human memory and dynamic interpretation.

> **Note:** Future versions may reorganize this table by category or priority. This version preserves alphabetical sorting to ease lookup.

> **Sidebar:** Shell terminology (e.g., cognitive shell, audit shell, fairness membrane) is used in place of "layer" to avoid implications of hierarchical dominance. At Civium’s core resides purpose, not power—Godstuff or its inferred axiomatic expressions.
