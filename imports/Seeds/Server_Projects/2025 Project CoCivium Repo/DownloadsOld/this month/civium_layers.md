# Civium Governance Layers

Civium proposes a scalable, interoperable model of democratic governance. This document describes how decision systems can operate across personal, local, regional, and global layers—while maintaining coherence and subsidiarity.

## Layer Model

### 1. **Personal Layer**
- **Scope:** Individual value systems, identity, tagging preferences, opt-ins.
- **Functions:** RepTag declaration, debate filtering, anonymity protection.
- **Rights:** Self-determination, privacy, exit/fork autonomy.

### 2. **Local Layer**
- **Scope:** Neighbourhoods, affinity groups, collectives.
- **Functions:** Group policy coordination, local consensus modules, vote calibration.
- **Rights:** Communal divergence, direct dispute mediation, protocol remixing.

### 3. **Regional Layer**
- **Scope:** Cities, nations, federated ecosystems.
- **Functions:** Legal interoperability, standards adoption, soft law agreements.
- **Rights:** Regional override, emergency arbitration, jurisdiction escalation.

### 4. **Global Layer**
- **Scope:** Planetary public goods, inter-Civium alignment.
- **Functions:** Global codex contributions, truth calibration, AI moderation frameworks.
- **Rights:** Mutual recognition, epistemic legitimacy export, resolution treaties.

## Design Principles

- **Subsidiarity**: Problems should be solved at the lowest layer possible.
- **Forkability**: Each layer must support graceful divergence and reconnection.
- **Legibility Control**: Communities define their preferred level of legibility to higher layers.
- **Modular Agreement**: Not all layers need to adopt the same codices—cross-layer negotiation is expected.

## Implementation Notes

- All layers share common codex anchors (e.g., truth, moderation, redress) but customize thresholds and priorities.
- Voting systems like RepMod adapt dynamically to layer context.
- A shared public-good AI layer provides moderation, simulation, and audit support.

This layered architecture allows Civium to operate across boundaries while preserving local autonomy and personal dignity.
