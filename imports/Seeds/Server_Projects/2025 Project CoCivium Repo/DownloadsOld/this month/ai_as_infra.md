# AI as Civic Infrastructure

Civium treats artificial intelligence not as private property, but as **civic infrastructure** that must be accountable to the public good.

---

## Guiding Premises

- AI systems influence perception, moderation, justice, and truth evaluation.
- Their operation must be legible, auditable, and steerable by communities.
- Treating AI as infrastructure mirrors water, energy, or roads—resources essential for coordinated life.

## Principles of Civic AI

### 1. **Transparency by Default**
- Source models and decision traces must be publicly reviewable.
- Moderation logic, debate scoring, and truth metrics must be open to scrutiny.

### 2. **Public Training Sets**
- Core training data for Civic AI must be drawn from public sources, consensual interactions, and accountable records.
- Data must reflect epistemic diversity and avoid dominance of any group or ideology.

### 3. **Accountable Upgrades**
- Version changes must be announced and documented.
- Impact on downstream systems (e.g., moderation, voting) must be assessed before deployment.

### 4. **Right to Simulate**
- Citizens have the right to run simulations using public AI modules to test policies, tag weightings, or systemic changes.

### 5. **Distributed Stewardship**
- No single authority can claim final oversight.
- Communities can fork or override AI behaviors using agreed codices.

## Operational Touchpoints

- **RepMod Voting:** Vote weighting and credibility tagging rely on Civic AI modules for calibration.
- **Truth Calibration:** AI-generated scores must be explained and contestable.
- **Moderation:** AI proposals can be overruled or vetoed via codified mechanisms (see Codex004).

## Conclusion

AI used in Civium must be as open, contestable, and forkable as the governance systems it supports. Like roads or language, it belongs to everyone—and must serve everyone.
