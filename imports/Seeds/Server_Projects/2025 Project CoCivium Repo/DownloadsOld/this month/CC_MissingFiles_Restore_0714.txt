restore: Re-sync essential scroll infra and metadata files

Restored files previously created by AI in earlier prepublication sessions:
- meta/AI_Prepublication_Scratchpad.md
- meta/Reviewer_Brief_Template.md
- meta/Preview_Targets.md
- meta/PREVIEW_OWNERS.md
- memory/contributors.yaml
- meta/intersessional_log.md
- language/scroll.md, civium.md, axiom.md, etc.

Ensures alignment with cumulative authoring work to date.
