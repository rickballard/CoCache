# Spiritual Reframings: Civium’s Lens on the Sacred

Civium is not a religion.

But it touches the same questions that religion has always tried to answer:
- What holds us together?
- What do we do with pain?
- What is worthy of trust?
- What does it mean to be whole?

As a civic medium, Civium cannot ignore the sacred.  
It must learn from it.  
Refactor it.  
And in some cases—complete it.

This document is a map of themes we will revisit, with care and curiosity, to see how Civium reshapes their meanings.

Each file will be its own doorway.

| Faith              | Probabilistic trust in multivalent futures   | Planned     |
| Judgment           | Systemic coherence testing, not condemnation | Planned     |

Each of these themes helped humanity survive fragmented history.  
But in Civium, fragmentation no longer reigns.

Now we ask:

> What does the sacred look like  
> when the medium itself is no longer broken?

The answers may not be easy.  
But they will be beautiful.
