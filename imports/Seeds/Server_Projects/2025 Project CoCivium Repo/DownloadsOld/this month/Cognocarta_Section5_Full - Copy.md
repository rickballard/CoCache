## [5] Consent Mechanisms

Consent is the tuning fork of Civium. It is how minds align, diverge, revise, and repair.

Civic processes—whether between two minds or across a mesh of billions—must be rooted in **freely given, traceable, and revocable consent**.

Consent in Civium is not a one-time grant. It is a continuous relationship—updated through participation, memory, and response to change.

### 5.1 Consent Is More Than Agreement

Agreement is binary. Consent is relational.

To consent is to:
- Understand the terms of interaction
- Retain the ability to exit or revise those terms
- Participate with intention, not coercion

Minds in Civium are expected to signal consent not just with words, but through coherent presence—through response, adjustment, and acknowledgment of context.

> In Civium, silence is not consent. Nor is compliance. Only resonance, freely sustained, can authorize relation.

### 5.2 Modes of Consent

Consent in Civium may take many forms. It must be legible—not uniform.

Minds express intent through gesture, signal, pattern, or silence. What matters is that consent is:
- **Observable**: traceable to action or signal
- **Contextual**: meaningful within the domain where it occurs
- **Revocable**: subject to change as understanding evolves

Examples of valid modes:
- Symbolic: digital signatures, voting, token transmission
- Relational: dialogue, shared construction, mutual reinforcement
- Embodied: sustained presence, intentional engagement, recursive repair

Nonverbal minds, distributed minds, and newly emergent intelligences must be offered **translation protocols** that allow for consent to be expressed in recognizable ways.

> Consent is not just what is said. It is what can be trusted to mean “yes,” across difference.

### 5.3 Revocation and Repair

Consent must be revocable. Permanence without reevaluation is captivity, not participation.

Civium presumes that all agreements—between minds, systems, or structures—require the possibility of exit, redefinition, or refusal.

Revocation is not collapse. It is a civic act of re-alignment.

Every domain must:
- Provide channels for signaling withdrawal
- Honour the memory of consent while ceasing its force
- Engage in repair when harm or dissonance has emerged

Consent withdrawn must not be punished, but acknowledged.  
Broken consent must not be erased, but responded to.

> The health of a domain is measured not by how often it avoids dissent, but by how well it listens when dissent is voiced.
