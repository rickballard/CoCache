## [6] Resolution Protocols

Civium anticipates friction. Conflict is not failureâ€”it is signal.  
What matters is how divergence is heard, held, and metabolized.

Resolution in Civium is not imposed peace. It is the **emergence of new coherence** through structured dissent and ethical recursion.

There is no universal resolution method. But all valid protocols must honor:
- Legibility of claims and responses
- Opportunities for revision without erasure
- Proportionality of response to civic harm

### 6.1 Resolution Is Not Erasure

To resolve is not to silence.  
Disputes may persist across domains, or remain suspended where coherence cannot yet be restored.

Civium must record, not suppress. It must enable:
- Partial truths to coexist while awaiting clarity
- Discordant presences to diverge without exile
- Repair processes to unfold over time

> In Civium, resolution is a rhythm, not a verdict.
