# Codex017: Soft Law and AI Auditability

This codex introduces the principles and operational mechanisms for **soft law** and **civic AI auditability** within Civium. These concepts allow communities to enforce accountability and transparency without coercion.

## üß† What is Soft Law?

Soft law refers to:
- Norms, warnings, and scores‚Äînot bans or deletions
- Probabilistic trust indicators, not absolute enforcement
- Moral gravity without legal monopoly

Soft law enables consensus without requiring domination.

## üîç Auditability Principles

Civium mandates that **all AI systems used in decision-making or moderation** meet the following standards:

### 1. **Traceable Logic**
- Each moderation or scoring action must produce a traceable reasoning trail
- Must cite codex rules, thresholds, and any AI-modified weights

### 2. **Simulatable Outcomes**
- Given the same inputs, any Civium AI module must yield reproducible results
- Simulations should be user-executable via Civic Tools

### 3. **Override Logging**
- Any human or system override of AI decisions must be logged to `/logs/override-log.md`
- Requires justification and optional community flagging

### 4. **Soft Warnings**
- Rather than deleting content, AI should recommend:
  - Delay tags
  - Context banners
  - RepMod score alerts
- Warnings are contestable and audit-linked

## üß± Operational Tools

- `audit.yaml` files may be attached to any codex for community or AI review
- Tools must support "Explain this outcome" features
- Soft Law Indicators must show source codex, logic path, and dissent margin

---

## üö® Anti-Opaque Clause

- Any Civium-affiliated AI tool must be independently auditable or subject to revocation
- Hidden logic = nonbinding logic

---

## üåê Scope

This codex applies to:
- All moderation systems
- All automated vote-weighting functions
- Any AI that proposes consensus paths

It does **not** override redress systems or codified rights.
