## 📁 Folder Logic

- `sections/` — Normative logic (axioms, rights, governance rules)  
- `codices/` — Modifiers: forks, dissenting interpretations, local adaptations  
- `appendices/` — Protocols, algorithms, simulation layers, ethical rulesets  
- `diagrams/` — Visual structure: process flows, nesting, recursion  
- `meta/` — Governance of the repo and its evolution  
- `lexicon/` — Shared language and cross-referenced terms
