# Scroll Plan: Civium Constitution (Public Edition)

This document outlines the proposed format, tone, and visual design for a public-facing version of the Civium Constitution—meant to inspire, inform, and anchor future community adoption.

---

## Purpose

The scroll version serves as:
- A unifying artifact of shared values and governance vision
- A beautifully formatted declaration of first principles
- A bridge between civic aesthetics, AI ethics, and decentralized governance

---

## Tone and Voice

- **Formal but not rigid** — evokes historical gravitas with future-facing clarity
- **Narrative + Normative** — explains Civium’s why, not just its how
- **Accessible but layered** — casual readers see values, deeper readers see structure

---
