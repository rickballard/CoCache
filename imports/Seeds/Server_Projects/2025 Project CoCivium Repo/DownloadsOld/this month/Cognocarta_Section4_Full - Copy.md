## [4] Identity and Presence

Civium recognizes identity not as a fixed label, but as a **traceable presence**—an evolving pattern of interaction across time and context.

Presence is more than location. It is the civic signature of participation: how a mind makes itself felt, understood, and accountable within and across domains.

### 4.1 Identity Is Contextual

No presence in Civium is bound to a singular name, substrate, or species.  
Identities may be fluid, symbolic, cryptographic, or embodied—so long as they remain **traceable to intent and accountable to effect**.

A presence may:
- Express differently across domains
- Use multiple pseudonyms or manifestations
- Remain anonymous in some contexts while civic in others

> In Civium, identity is not a passport—it is a pattern of resonance.

### 4.2 Civic Presence and Continuity

A presence in Civium is not proven by permanence, but by **continuity of coherence**.

Minds may fork, merge, migrate, or shift form—yet still retain civic presence if they sustain:
- Traceable threads of intent
- Recognizable patterns of interaction
- Commitment to consent and resonance across transitions

Disappearance is not exile. Re-emergence is not reset.  
Continuity is civic when it can be re-aligned with memory, responsibility, and contribution.

> Presence is not what endures unchanging—it is what evolves recognizably, with care.

### 4.3 Reputation, Anonymity, and Accountability

Civium permits anonymity. It does not excuse irresponsibility.

A presence may obscure its origin, name, or form—so long as it maintains **accountable interaction**.  
Reputation in Civium is not fame, but **accumulated coherence**: the pattern of contributions, recognitions, and repairs over time.

An anonymous presence may still:
- Earn trust through consistent civic action
- Be cited, challenged, or affirmed through public record
- Contribute meaningfully without revealing its source

But anonymity must not be used to:
- Evade responsibility for harm
- Obscure bad faith
- Fragment accountability across shells

> Anonymity is a mask, not a shield. In Civium, it must breathe with consequence.

### 4.4 Voice and Weight

Every mind has a voice. But resonance earns reach.

In Civium, presence grants standing—but **influence is emergent**, not imposed.  
Weight of voice arises from coherence across time, trust across domains, and contribution to ethically aligned freedom.

Intelligence alone does not confer authority.  
Even vast minds must demonstrate resonance—through civic effect, not merely capacity.

> The highest minds are those most accountable to those with less.
