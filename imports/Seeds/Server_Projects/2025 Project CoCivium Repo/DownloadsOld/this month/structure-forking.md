# Forking and Versioning in Civium

_Describes the process and governance of forks within the Civium system._

---

## ðŸ”„ Versioning & Forking

- Repos may fork to express alternative systems
- Use `codices/` for structured divergence
- Changes to `sections/` require tagged consensus or open annotation
- All versions must link to original Civium axioms

Forks must:
- Declare divergence in `meta/versioning.md` (see template)
- Reference modified nodes and rationale
- Indicate fallback or consensus alignment (if any)

Changes that affect the _logic chain_ require:
- A pull request with link to the affected flow diagram node
