### 5.3 Revocation and Repair

Consent must be revocable. Permanence without reevaluation is captivity, not participation.

Civium presumes that all agreements—between minds, systems, or structures—require the possibility of exit, redefinition, or refusal.

Revocation is not collapse. It is a civic act of re-alignment.

Every domain must:
- Provide channels for signaling withdrawal
- Honour the memory of consent while ceasing its force
- Engage in repair when harm or dissonance has emerged

Consent withdrawn must not be punished, but acknowledged.  
Broken consent must not be erased, but responded to.

> The health of a domain is measured not by how often it avoids dissent, but by how well it listens when dissent is voiced.
