## üß≠ Workflow Protocol Initiated
- User will upload the latest repo `.zip` at start of every session
- Assistant must inspect and derive continuity from repo, not memory
- Deprecated scrolls preserved for mining, not deletion### 2025-07-15

- Deleted obsolete `/language/` and `/glossary/` folders
- Consolidated all glossary terms, validators, and semantic controls into `/civilish/`
- Verified no valuable files remained in old directories
- `/civilish/Glossary_Term_Lookup_v0.3.md` is now the canonical semantic index
