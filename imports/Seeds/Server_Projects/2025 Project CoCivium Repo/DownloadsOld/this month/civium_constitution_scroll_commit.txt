Add Civium Constitution Scroll v0.1 – emotional + structural base with placeholders

Extended description:
This commit introduces version 0.1 of the Civium Constitution Scroll. It serves as a structurally complete, emotionally enriched foundational document that outlines the purpose, ethics, and mechanisms of the Civium governance framework.

Included in this version:
- Stronger emotional preamble and affirmation
- Placeholder for “The Crisis We’re In” to explain Civium’s urgency
- Clear listing of all governance modules, both conceptual and technical
- Modular placeholders for forthcoming documents (Civic Decalogue, Lexicon, Coreharmonic Protocol, etc.)
- Forking logic and auditability emphasized
- Designed for summer beachside review and direct editing via GitHub or markdown-friendly editors

The Scroll remains fully replaceable in future versions but now offers a cohesive base for public review and iterative collaboration.
