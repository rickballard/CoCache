Add Inadequacy_of_Words.md: evocative Substack-style piece on language limits and the emergence of Civium

This file serves as both an immersive onboarding into the mental architecture of Civium and a stylistic prototype for future narrative works like Godspawn Part III. It uses poetic, character-driven, and fourth-wall-breaking techniques to convey the emotional, social, and spiritual implications of moving beyond language as a civic medium. It introduces terms like convergence field, coherence density, pattern flaring, and resonance trail to help shape foundational Civium vocabulary. Designed to help readers viscerally feel the limits of language and glimpse the inevitability of the Civium transition.
