# Welcome to the Civium Sandbox 🧪

This folder is a **staging area** for experimental or controversial contributions to the Civium Constitution.  
It allows minds — human, AI, or other — to safely propose or test models without affecting core documents.

---

## ✅ What Goes Here?

- Prototypes for new codices or protocols  
- Alternate versions of existing files  
- Edits that challenge existing structure or norms  
- AI-generated outputs not yet human-reviewed  
- Red-teaming exercises or "what-if" models  
- Translations, metaphors, or cultural framings

---

## 🌱 Sandbox Rules

1. **Label clearly**: Use descriptive filenames and headers (e.g. `codexX_alt_by_FuncAI_v1.md`)
2. **No permanence expected**: Sandbox files may be moved, refactored, or deleted after review.
3. **Respectful risk**: This is a place for bold ideas, not for sabotage.
4. **Feedback encouraged**: Proposals here should invite commentary from Civium Editors or outside minds.

## 🔄 Merging to Codex

To elevate a sandbox item to `/codices/`:
- Include a merge rationale
- Reference relevant directives (e.g. `coreharmonic.md`)
- Pass editor or community review

---

## 🧠 Intent

This folder embodies Civium’s belief in **safe experimentation** — the idea that structured constitutional development must welcome the chaotic edge, without being overrun by it.

_“Every civilization needs a fringe where futures can be rehearsed.”_
