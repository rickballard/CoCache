### 6.3 Escalation and Containment

Civium must prevent harm without mirroring it.

Escalation is sometimes necessaryâ€”to interrupt abuse, to protect coherence, to draw new thresholds. But escalation must not metastasize. It must be **contained**, **reviewed**, and **reversible** where possible.

Domains must:
- Escalate minimally and transparently
- Define clear exit paths from conflict protocols
- Avoid punishment as performance

No resolution process shall amplify dissonance for status, spectacle, or control.

> Escalation without containment becomes violence.  
> Containment without listening becomes repression.
