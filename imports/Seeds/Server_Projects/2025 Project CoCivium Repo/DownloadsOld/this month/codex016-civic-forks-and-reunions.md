# Codex016: Civic Forks and Reunions

In Civium, forking is a protected right—not a failure mode. Communities may diverge, pause affiliation, or form parallel systems. This codex describes the principles, mechanics, and reconciliation patterns of civic forks.

---

## Forks as Ethical Infrastructure

- Forking is a **safety valve** and a signal of legitimate dissent.
- The ability to exit creates incentives for accountability.
- Forks should be logged, tagged, and narrativized—not erased.

---

## Types of Forks

### 1. **Value Fork**
- Community splits due to ideological divergence (e.g. rights interpretation, policy prioritization).
- Outcomes: two communities with shared ancestry but distinct codex preferences.

### 2. **Procedural Fork**
- Split over governance mechanics (e.g. vote thresholds, tag effects).
- Often resolved via codex modification and reunification trials.

### 3. **Trust Fork**
- Triggered by loss of confidence in moderators, AI layer, or audit transparency.
- May involve migration to a new instance with fresh legitimacy recalibration.

## Reunification Patterns

- **Bridge Codex**: Temporary shared protocol to test re-alignment before full merge.
- **Dual Recognition**: Communities acknowledge each other's legitimacy without merging.
- **Credential Portability**: Citizens may carry tags, reputations, and vote weights between forks.

---

## Fork Governance Protocol

1. **Divergence Proposal Filed** (requires threshold support).
2. **Fork Statement Logged** in the public override ledger.
3. **Codex Derivation Declared** (indicating inheritance or mutation).
4. **Option to Rejoin** must be documented, with review period.

---

## Anti-Coercion Doctrine

- No community may force reintegration.
- Cross-fork alliances must be opt-in and revocable.

---

## Alignment with Civium Principles

- Forks preserve **pluralism**, **autonomy**, and **truth integrity**.
- Reunions preserve **coordination**, **legitimacy**, and **collective memory**.

Civium welcomes divergence as a path to stronger systems—so long as the door remains open for return.
