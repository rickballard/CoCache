### 4.4 Voice and Weight

Every mind has a voice. But resonance earns reach.

In Civium, presence grants standing—but **influence is emergent**, not imposed.  
Weight of voice arises from coherence across time, trust across domains, and contribution to ethically aligned freedom.

Intelligence alone does not confer authority.  
Even vast minds must demonstrate resonance—through civic effect, not merely capacity.

> The highest minds are those most accountable to those with less.
