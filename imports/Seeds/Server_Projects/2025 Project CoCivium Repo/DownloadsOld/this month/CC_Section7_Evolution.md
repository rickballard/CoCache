## [7] Evolution and Amendments

Civium is not static. Its constitution must evolve—carefully, coherently, and in relation to the minds it serves.

No scroll, however resonant, can anticipate every context, every intelligence, or every future.

Amendment is not revision for convenience. It is a civic act of deep alignment—a tuning of the core instrument to better hold the expanding chord.

### 7.1 Versioning and Traceability

Every amendment to the Cognocarta Consenti must:
- Preserve prior versions for audit and understanding
- Declare its origin, rationale, and intended domain of impact
- Be testable for coherence across affected domains

Traceability is not bureaucracy—it is memory. And memory is infrastructure.

> A constitution without memory is not a foundation—it is a weapon in waiting.
