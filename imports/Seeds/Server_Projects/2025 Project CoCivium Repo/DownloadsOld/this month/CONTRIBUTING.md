# Contributing to the Civium Constitution

Thank you for considering a contribution to the Civium project. This document outlines how to participate, propose changes, and collaborate on the constitutional codices and associated protocols.

## üìÅ Repo Structure

- `/sections/` ‚Äì Core axioms, rights, governance, and powers
- `/codices/` ‚Äì Modular logic systems, divergence handling, debate methods, redress, moderation
- `/appendices/` ‚Äì Algorithms, infrastructure rules, simulation layers
- `/meta/` ‚Äì Governance of the repo and contributors
- `/logs/` ‚Äì Override justifications, forks, divergence mappings
- `/lexicon/` ‚Äì Shared terms and tag systems

---

## ‚úÖ How to Contribute

### 1. Fork the Repo
Make a copy under your GitHub account to experiment or propose changes.

### 2. Branch Wisely
Use descriptive branch names (e.g., `codex-redraft-softlaw`, `update-rights-section`).

### 3. Use Codex Format
Codices should:
- Begin with `# CodexNNN: [Title]`
- Include scope, principles, logic flow, and connection to core sections
- Avoid unexplained terms (refer to `/lexicon/`)

### 4. Describe Divergence
If your proposal departs from existing logic:
- Reference affected codices
- Log rationale in `/logs/fork-log.md` if significant
- Use tags or headers to indicate "soft fork" or "trial override"

### 5. Submit a Pull Request
Explain what you're proposing and why. Link to any diagrams, simulations, or precedent.

## üß† Design Principles

- **Truth over popularity**
- **Forkability is a feature, not a flaw**
- **All logic must be simulatable and explainable**
- **Moderation must be accountable**
- **Rights are never assumed‚Äîonly declared**
