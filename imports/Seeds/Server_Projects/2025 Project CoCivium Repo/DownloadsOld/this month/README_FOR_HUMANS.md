Welcome to the **Cognocarta Consenti** repository — the constitutional kernel of *Civium*, a post-national, multi-intelligence civic framework.

This repository contains the foundational documents, frameworks, and living governance architecture for Civium — a society intended to include all sentient minds, whether biological, artificial, or yet-to-be-discovered.
