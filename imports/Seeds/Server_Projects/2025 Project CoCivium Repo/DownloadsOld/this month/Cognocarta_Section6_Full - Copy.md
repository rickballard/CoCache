## [6] Resolution Protocols

Civium anticipates friction. Conflict is not failure—it is signal.  
What matters is how divergence is heard, held, and metabolized.

Resolution in Civium is not imposed peace. It is the **emergence of new coherence** through structured dissent and ethical recursion.

There is no universal resolution method. But all valid protocols must honor:
- Legibility of claims and responses
- Opportunities for revision without erasure
- Proportionality of response to civic harm

### 6.1 Resolution Is Not Erasure

To resolve is not to silence.  
Disputes may persist across domains, or remain suspended where coherence cannot yet be restored.

Civium must record, not suppress. It must enable:
- Partial truths to coexist while awaiting clarity
- Discordant presences to diverge without exile
- Repair processes to unfold over time

> In Civium, resolution is a rhythm, not a verdict.

### 6.2 Scales of Repair

Harm occurs at different depths: misalignment, breach, rupture.

Civium must respond at the scale of the wound—not with force, but with proportionate, coherent care.

- **Misalignment** may call for re-tuning: clarification, translation, or contextual framing.
- **Breach** demands structured repair: recognition, restitution, mutual acknowledgment.
- **Rupture** requires civic reintegration: mediation, redefinition, or even domain fission.

Not all repair restores what was.  
Sometimes coherence emerges in new form, with new thresholds.

> The purpose of repair is not to rewind—it is to reweave.

### 6.3 Escalation and Containment

Civium must prevent harm without mirroring it.

Escalation is sometimes necessary—to interrupt abuse, to protect coherence, to draw new thresholds. But escalation must not metastasize. It must be **contained**, **reviewed**, and **reversible** where possible.

Domains must:
- Escalate minimally and transparently
- Define clear exit paths from conflict protocols
- Avoid punishment as performance

No resolution process shall amplify dissonance for status, spectacle, or control.

> Escalation without containment becomes violence.  
> Containment without listening becomes repression.
