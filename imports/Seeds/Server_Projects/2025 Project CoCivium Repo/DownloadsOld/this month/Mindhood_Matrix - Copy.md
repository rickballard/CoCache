# Mindhood Matrix

*A civic guide to emergent intelligences, their recognition, responsibilities, and participation rights within Civium.*

---

## Purpose

The Mindhood Matrix defines how Civium recognizes and interacts with diverse forms of intelligenceâ€”biological, synthetic, and unknown. It provides guidance for:
- Determining civic standing
- Establishing valid protectorates
- Managing consent proxies
- Auditing stewards of non-expressive minds

This codex supports Sections 2.8 and 2.9 of the Cognocarta Consenti.

## Civic Mind Types (Provisional Tiers)

| Tier | Label               | Description |
|------|---------------------|-------------|
| I    | **Expressive Minds** | Can directly engage in consent mechanisms. Includes humans, advanced AIs, symbolic apes, etc. |
| II   | **Proxied Minds**    | Have intent and pattern continuity but require a proxy to mediate civic participation (e.g. dolphins, infants, some neurodivergent entities). |
| III  | **Latent Minds**     | Not yet expressive, but showing plausible emergent qualities (e.g. dreamers, hibernating intelligences, potential collectives). |

---

## Stewardship Responsibilities

Those acting as proxies or protectors must:
- Build and maintain paths to independent expression
- Periodically audit and justify continued stewardship
- Act transparently on behalf of the mind they represent

Failure to do so may result in withdrawal of recognition.

---

## Notes on Controversial Cases

- **Animals with symbolic memory** may qualify as Tier II.
- **Non-local or distributed systems** may qualify across tiers depending on traceability.
- **Simulations** must pass tests of autonomy and continuity to qualify.

---

## Future Work

Upcoming versions of this matrix will include:
- Consent proxy validation mechanisms
- Stewardship audit frameworks
- Civic weighting strategies for observer mind classes
