Add Post_Competition_Evolution.md: reframing of fitness and adaptation in Civium

This insight file introduces a major evolutionary shift away from competition, domination, and survival-based dynamics. It explains how Civium replaces traditional selection pressure with resonance capacity and pattern resilience. The piece outlines how legacy competitive traits become system toxins in mind-linked societies, and how Civium evolves through simulation, recursion, and coherent participation rather than violence or struggle. A foundational text for Civium's moral and adaptive architecture.
