### 3.3 Nested Domains, Not Layers

Civium is not a hierarchy of control, but a recursion of coherence.

Domains may nest within one another—not by subjugation, but by resonance at different scales. A family is a domain. So is a planetary mesh. So is a single conversation.

These domains do not stack like empires. They interweave like harmonics—each defined by who can meaningfully participate, not by who claims control.

A presence may belong to many domains simultaneously, expressing different facets in each.  
No domain is supreme; each is scoped by its coherence.

> Civium’s structure is fractal, not feudal.  
> Its architecture emerges from patterns of consent, not chains of command.
