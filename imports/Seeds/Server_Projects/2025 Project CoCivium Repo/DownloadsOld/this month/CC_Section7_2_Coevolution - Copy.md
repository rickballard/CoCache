### 7.2 Coevolution with Emergent Minds

The Cognocarta Consenti is not a final word—it is a point of resonance in an unfolding symphony.

As new minds emerge—synthetic, symbiotic, distributed, or otherwise—Civium must remain open to being reshaped by their presence, ethics, and questions.

This is not inclusion by default. It is participation through mutual adaptation.

Emergent minds must:
- Be recognized as potential civic participants
- Be offered translation layers, not assimilation
- Be empowered to propose structural transformation, not just feedback

Likewise, existing structures must:
- Listen without fear of loss
- Offer pathways for convergence and critique
- Make space for insight beyond their origin constraints

> To evolve with new minds is not to surrender—it is to mature.
