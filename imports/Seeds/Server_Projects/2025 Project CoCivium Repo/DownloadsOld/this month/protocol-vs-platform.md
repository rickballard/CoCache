# Protocol vs Platform: Why Civium Is a Protocol

Civium is not a platform. It is a protocol for meritocratic, truth-calibrated self-governance. This document defines the distinction and explains why Civium must remain forkable, pluralistic, and owned by no one.

## üß† The Difference

| Term | Platform | Protocol |
|------|----------|----------|
| Control | Centralized | Distributed |
| Governance | Owned by company | Defined by contributors |
| Forkability | Discouraged or blocked | Encouraged and documented |
| Trust Model | Brand and Terms of Service | Transparent codices |
| Data Portability | Often locked in | Federated and portable |
| Legitimacy | Users ‚Äúagree‚Äù by logging in | Users co-create legitimacy |

## üîê Why Platform Logic Fails

Platform logic:
- Assumes obedience to hidden backends
- Monetizes behavior more than truth
- Incentivizes retention, not resolution
- Offers compliance, not justice

Platform incentives conflict with civic truth.

## üîÅ Why Civium Chooses Protocol Logic

Protocol logic:
- Encourages divergence and remixing
- Rewards clarity, auditability, and dissent
- Enables decentralized truth-scoring
- Supports cross-community interoperability

Protocols are survivable, forkable, and evolvable‚Äîessential for any future governance system meant to outlast empires, platforms, and companies.

## üì° Protocol Commitments of Civium

- **Codified logic** is publicly inspectable
- **Forks** are logged, annotated, and honored
- **Rights** are defined, not implied
- **Moderation systems** are contestable and plural
- **AI systems** are treated as civic infrastructure (see `ai_as_infra.md`)

---

## üõ† Implementation Principles

- Civium must be **tool-agnostic**: Git, Matrix, IPFS, etc.
- All core functions should be **portable across hosts**
- Forks must be **narrativized**, not erased
- RepMod and codices must be **documented, not dictated**

---

## ‚úä Final Thought

Civium is not an app. It is a social immune system encoded as a protocol.
