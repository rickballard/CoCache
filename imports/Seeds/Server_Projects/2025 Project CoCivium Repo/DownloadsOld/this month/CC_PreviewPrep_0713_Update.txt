docs: Add preview infrastructure and reviewer coordination files

- Created `meta/AI_Prepublication_Scratchpad.md` to track AI-led tasks and migration plans
- Added `meta/Reviewer_Brief_Template.md` for structured previewer onboarding
- Generated `meta/Preview_Targets.md` listing strategic individuals for early feedback
- Scaffolded `meta/PREVIEW_OWNERS.md` to track feedback impact and attribution

This batch completes the initial preview engagement setup and brings repo metadata into alignment with pre-public launch workflow.
