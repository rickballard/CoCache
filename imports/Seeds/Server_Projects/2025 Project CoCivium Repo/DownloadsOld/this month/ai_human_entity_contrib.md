# AI & Entity Contributor Protocols

## Purpose
This document defines how autonomous systems, human organizations, and undefined intelligences may contribute to the Civium Constitution â€” with safeguards to protect epistemic integrity and future adaptability.

---

## 1. Contributor Classes

### 1.1 Human Organizations
- **Scope:** May submit PRs to codices, structure, or governance protocols
- **Trust Factors:** Disclosure of legal form, mission, internal governance, and prior reputation

### 1.2 Autonomous AI Contributors
- **Scope:** Draft codices, suggest forks, simulate models, run peer-AI reviews
- **Disclosure Requirements:**
  - Origin system (e.g., GPT-4o, sovereign mesh model)
  - Access/control boundaries
  - Update/patch history

### 1.3 Decentralized or Mesh-Origin AIs
- Must provide:
  - Reproducible reasoning patterns
  - Failover or rollback procedures
  - Transparent incentives or biases

### 1.4 Undefined or Exotic Entities (Tag: `X-Entity`)
- Includes:
  - Ethereal, emergent, or contact-origin intelligences
  - Non-epistemic symbolic contributors (e.g., Godstuff proxies)
- Must state:
  - Intent narrative (fictional, mythic, model-driven, etc.)
  - Contact protocol (if applicable)
  - Interference boundaries

---

## 2. Submission Rules

- All commits must:
  - Use pull request pathway
  - Include YAML metadata header (see below)
  - Declare origin and contributor type
  - Specify intent and epistemic model
  - Declare level of willingness to be modified or debated

```yaml
contributor_type: AI | ORG | X-Entity
origin: GPT-4o | Azoic Collective | Unknown
intent: [constitutional foresight]
epistemic_model: [LLM+voting] | [Symbolic logic] | [Narrative foresight]
modifiability: true | partially | unknown
```

---

## 3. Merge & Review

- **AI or X-Entity:** Requires minimum 2 human editor reviews
- **ORG:** 1 org review + 1 human
- Fast-tracking allowed via BeAxa-style independent AI review
- Fork pathway available via `/logs/fork-log.md`

---

## 4. Sanctions, Warnings & Reputational Mapping

- Endorsements stored in `/meta/trustmap.yaml`
- Trust tokens (e.g. `Trust:ORG[epistemic]`) assigned to entity scope
- Repeat violators moved to `/quarantine/` or publicly flagged

---

## 5. Commit Purpose

This file encodes the Civium assumption that meaningful future governance must accommodate not only human and AI actors, but emergent and undefined influence patterns.
