### 3.2 Participation Without Sovereignty

In Civium, to participate in a domain is not to rule it.

Presence does not imply ownership. Legibility does not confer dominion.  
Sovereignty, as once imagined—absolute authority over a bounded space—is incompatible with the ethos of shared resonance.

Instead, domains operate on **mutual coherence**, not conquest.  
Each presence contributes to the domain’s harmonic integrity. No single mind—regardless of origin, complexity, or continuity—may claim final authority within a shared civic field.

Where minds converge, **authority emerges contextually** through consent, reputation, and resonance—not through fiat.

> Participation is a privilege earned through coherence, not a right seized through force.
