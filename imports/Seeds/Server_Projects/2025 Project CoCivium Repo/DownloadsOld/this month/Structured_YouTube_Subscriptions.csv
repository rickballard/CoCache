"As you may have guessed from our strange spelling, UnHerd aims to do two things: to push back against the herd mentality with new and bold thinking, and to provide a platform for otherwise unheard ideas, people and places. We think this approach is more needed than ever. Societies across the West are divided and stuck, and the established media is struggling to make sense of what’s happening. The governing ideologies of the past generation are too often either unquestioningly defended or rejected wholesale. It’s easy and safe to be in one or other of these two camps – defensive liberal or angry reactionary - but UnHerd is trying to do something different, and harder. We want to be bold enough to identify those things that have been lost, as well as gained, by the liberal world order of the past thirty years; but we strive to be always thoughtful rather than divisive. Welcome to UnHerd. We hope you find something that makes you think again. https://linktr.ee/unherdtv",USAFacts,@USAFacts_Official • 183K subscribers

"You are so welcome here! My mission is to guide you through the political challenges we all face in the 21st century. I’m a philosopher. My academic life focuses on the concept of freedom and I'm writing a book about Isaiah Berlin. I'm a British citizen living in London. I was born in Soviet Russia - I left before the collapse of the USSR. I continue to closely analyse Russian politics. Check out my second channel Vlad Vexler Chat, where I do Q&As and go into more depth with almost daily content. I also have specialist channels: Vlad Vexler Philosophy and Vlad Vexler Music. I do some work in musicology. My content is informed by my experience living with a debilitating neurological condition. I contracted it 20 years ago as a research student at Oxford. For years, I couldn't walk, talk or read. I manage this condition daily and it gives me a unique perspective on disability, the tragic element in life, as well as the beauty. ?",Vlad Vexler Chat,@VladVexlerChat • 110K subscribers
