# Governance & Ownership Mandate

## Purpose
Protect CoAgent’s neutrality and public trust so no single AI vendor (or investor) can capture or silence it.

## Principles
- **Neutrality**: CoAgent belongs to no AI vendor. It must run any model’s DO files (LLM-agnostic).
- **Local-first**: Execution happens on user/organizational machines. Cloud is optional and consent-based.
- **Consent-first**: Nothing runs or leaves a device without explicit consent.
- **Transparency**: Specs, risk rules, and update signing are public. No dark patterns.

## Structure
- **Steward**: CoCivium Foundation (or successor, DAO/co-op acceptable) is the legal owner of CoAgent IP and trademark.
- **Runtime**: CoAgent binary and DO Header Spec remain free and open (permissive license + governance bylaws below).
- **Ecosystem**: CoModules (free/paid) are layered atop CoAgent; revenues fund developers, ops, and community bounties.

## Consent Lock (No-Sale Clause)
- Any transfer of CoAgent IP, governance rights, or material trademark control requires:
  1) **≥ 75% supermajority** of a representative CoCivium stakeholder council, and
  2) **≥ 75% supermajority** of an **AI-neutral Oversight Board** (members cannot be employed by or funded >10% by a single AI vendor).
- **Golden Constraint**: Transfers to entities majority-owned/controlled by any single AI vendor are **disallowed**.
- This clause is embedded in: license rider, bylaws, and contributor agreement.

## Funding & Compensation
- **Free Core**: CoAgent remains free for individuals and enterprises.
- **Revenue**: Flows through paid CoModules (e.g., Policy Audit, Risk Linter, RepTag dashboards).
- **Use of Funds**: Core dev salaries (including long-term founder role), signing infra, security audits, community bounties, and documentation.
- **No Exit Jackpot**: There is no equity event that compromises neutrality. Contributors are paid for work; the community keeps stewardship.

## Compliance & Trust
- **Signed updates**; public keys pinned in docs.
- **Immutable logs**; optional enterprise audit vault (paid module).
- **Privacy posture**: Never upload raw organizational data; optional anonymized generics export only with explicit consent/policy.
- **Open standard**: DO Header Spec changes require public RFC and timeboxed comment period.

## Amendment Process
- Changes to this mandate require the same **dual supermajority** and a public RFC with a minimum 21-day comment period.
