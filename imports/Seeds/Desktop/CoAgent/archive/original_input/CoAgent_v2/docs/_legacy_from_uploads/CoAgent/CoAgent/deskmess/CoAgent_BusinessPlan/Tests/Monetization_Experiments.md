# Monetization Experiments (CoModules)

## Hypotheses
H-1: Policy Audit trials convert at ≥15% when surfaced after a policy conflict.
H-2: Risk Linter exports justify a Pro seat in security-conscious teams.

## Experiments
E-1: In-context prompt: “Policy conflict detected → run free audit?” → track clicks, completions.
E-2: Risk Linter report export (JSON/PDF) → ask “keep generating these?” → soft paywall for enterprises only.

## Metrics
- Trials / 100 CoAgent runs
- Trial→paid conversion %
- Time-to-first-value (TTFV)
