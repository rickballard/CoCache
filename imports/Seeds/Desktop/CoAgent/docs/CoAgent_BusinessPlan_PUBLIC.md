# CoAgent — Product Overview (Public Draft)

**What it is:** Guardrailed, auditable coordination for concurrent repo work.  
**Why it matters:** Reduce collisions, add consent gates, capture provenance — without blocking flow.

## MVP
- Local runtime (file-queues), one watcher per session
- DO/Note bridge, launcher, status tooling
- Consent flags for writes/network; logs per task

## Roadmap (abridged)
- Packaging, consent prompts, debounce/lockfile, compact-on-exit
- Policy packs, conflict heuristics/prompts, repo intents
- Team orchestration, editor/repo integrations
