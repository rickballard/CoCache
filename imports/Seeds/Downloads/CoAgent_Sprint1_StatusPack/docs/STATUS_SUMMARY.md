# Sprint 1 Status Summary

**As of:** 2025-09-10 02:24:54

## What’s in place
- Two sessions: **co-planning** and **co-migrate**
- One watcher **per** session (background jobs named `CoQueueWatcher-<session>`)
- DO/Note bridge: `Drop-CoDO`, `Send-CoNote`
- Launcher can open **two Chat tabs** + docs; greetings saved under `CoTemp\greetings`
- Smoke DO verified with PowerShell version logged
- Read-only RepoScan DO fixed; lists up to 50 files

## Likely gaps to push to repo
- Final copies of: watcher policy note, stabilized `Status-QuickCheck.ps1`, greetings (UTF‑8/ASCII-safe)
- Planning docs you generated today (positioning, roadmap, MVP smokes, PRD draft)
- Backlog items (e.g., debounce/lockfile, compact-on-exit)
- Any local runbook updates made in chat

Use `scripts/Harvest-CoTemp-ToRepo.ps1` to stage these into your repo working tree (no commits done automatically).
