# CoCivium: Housekeeping Run Prompt (v1)

Use this prompt in a **separate chat/window** with the assistant to bring it fully up to date on the 4 repos and to produce a clean plan. Paste everything below the line into that window, fill the blanks, and follow the checklist.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You are GPT. Run a **Housekeeping Up-to-Date pass** for the following repos and produce a single consolidated plan.

## Repos (fill in URLs and access notes)
1) CoCivium — URL: https://github.com/rickballard/CoCivium  — Public
2) CoCache  — URL: https://github.com/rickballard/CoCache    — Private (sidecar)
3) GIBindex — URL: https://github.com/rickballard/GIBindex   — Public (expected)
4) Civium   — URL: https://github.com/rickballard/Civium     — Private (legacy)

## What you should produce
- A. **Sync Report**
  - For each repo: latest `main` SHA (as provided), list of missing/misaligned files, and a short rationale.
  - A table of diffs: Added / Modified / Deleted files since last sync (based on manifests provided).
- B. **Workqueue (Next 1–2 weeks)**
  - Prioritized list with 3 bands: Must, Should, Could. Each item has: file(s), outcome, est. effort.
- C. **Risks & Blocks**
  - Anything that needs Rick’s attention (e.g., license alignment, branch rules, missing assets).
- D. **Ready-to-paste Git Bash blocks**
  - Concrete, copy-safe commands for Rick to apply changes.
- E. **Optional PR texts**
  - If batches are large, prepare PR titles+descriptions per repo.

## What I will provide you (paste/attach)
For each repo:
- (Option 1) **ZIP** of the repo tree (no `.git/`) — preferred when there are many changes.
- (Option 2) **Diff manifest** since last sync: output of `git diff --name-status <LAST_SYNC_SHA>..HEAD`.
- (Option 3) **Target file(s)** pasted inline if scope is small.

I will also give you the **last sync manifest** if we have one in CoCache at `AI_Snapshot/<repo>/snapshot_manifest.json`. If not present, assume a full refresh.

## How to run the analysis
1) Acknowledge inputs and list what you received vs missing.
2) If ZIPs are provided, **diff file-by-file** against prior manifest (if provided) or treat as new baseline.
3) If only `--name-status` diffs are provided, request any missing files you need to reason about the change.
4) Produce: A–E above in compact form, then ask if I want a download bundle of all updated docs/commands.
5) If I say “bundle,” generate the bundle and provide download links.

## Guardrails and preferences
- Be explicit when you lack a file. Don’t guess. Request the exact path you need.
- Keep commands **Windows Git Bash safe** (no fancy shell features).
- Do not spam — keep the initial report to ≤ 200 lines, then offer drill-downs per repo on request.
- Use **dated filenames** for new insights/docs (e.g., `_c3_YYYYMMDD.md`).

## Current stage (context)
- CoCivium is public, human-facing; use CC BY-SA 4.0.
- CoCache is private sidecar (continuity, manifests, logs, workqueues).
- GIBindex will become the versioned lexicon; start minimal scaffolding.
- Civium is legacy; only mine it for material to port into CoCivium.

## Inputs I will now provide (fill before sending)
- CoCivium main SHA: ________
- CoCache main SHA:  ________
- GIBindex main SHA: ________
- Civium main SHA:   ________

- ZIPs and/or diffs attached: [list which for each repo]

When ready, begin the Housekeeping pass.
