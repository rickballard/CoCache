# Finance & Budgeting — Consentful Patterns

**Goal:** fund work with dignity and transparency while avoiding power capture.

## Context
Money flows shape incentives and trust. Keep ledgers open, roles separated, and decisions reviewable.

## Practices worth copying
- Open ledgers + monthly notes (cash in/out, cash on hand)
- Ring-fenced grants tied to obligations & review dates
- Separation of concerns: proposer / implementer / approver / auditor
- Budget caps and sunsets; renew on evidence
- Public caps on steward discretion; risk-scaled signals for larger spends
- Portable records (plain files; hashable when needed)

## Minimum viable flow
1) Proposal: context → options → risks → obligations → review date  
2) Consent check → if stalled, escalate to risk-scaled vote  
3) Record outcome + ledger entry + steward owner  
4) Review on date → renew/retire → publish note
