# Grand Migration — BPOE Centralization Report
Timestamp: 2025-09-15 21:33 UTC

## What was done (high level)
- **Centralized BPOE** in `CoCache` with:
  - Reusable workflows: `bpoe-smoke.yml`, `bpoe-safety-gate.yml`, `bpoe-self-evolve.yml`
  - PS7 module: `module/BPOE.Autopilot` (exports `Invoke-BPOEAssetsManifest`, `Test-BPOERepoSmoke`)
- **InSeed** was shimed to consume the central workflows (feature branches already created/pushed).
- **Site polish** added to InSeed: `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`, `site.webmanifest`, `404.html`, and meta tags for OG/Twitter. README gained a CI health badge block.

## Outstanding
- Your CoCache push failed due to a giant file added by accident: `docs/index/ADVICE-INDEX.md` (>100 MB).  
  We must **remove** it from the commit and push again (no history rewrite needed since it’s a single local commit you made). Use `NEXT_STEPS.ps1`.

## Branches & PRs touched
- `InSeed` feature branches (examples seen in logs):
  - `polish/auto-setup-YYYYMMDD`
  - `polish/bpoe-centralize-20250915` with shims + site polish
- A PR exists: `https://github.com/rickballard/InSeed/pull/1` (per your earlier output).

## Where breadcrumbs live (SoT)
- **System of Truth:** `CoCache` repo
  - Workflows: `.github/workflows/bpoe-*.yml`
  - Module: `module/BPOE.Autopilot/*`
  - Advice & migration notes live under `docs/` (keep them lightweight to avoid large-file pushes).
- **Per-repo breadcrumbs (consumers):**
  - `docs/bpoe/SESSION_STATUS.md` (refreshed by self‑evolve)
  - README badges block delimited by `<!-- BPOE:STATUS-BADGES BEGIN/END -->`

## Why centralization?
- Single point of change: update once in CoCache → all repos pick up improvements.
- Fewer repo diffs, smaller PRs, uniform security posture (safety-gate), and consistent smoke semantics.
- Enables “self‑evolve” across the fleet via a single boolean repo variable (`ENABLE_AUTOCOMMITS`).

## Notes
- Ensure **PowerShell 7** is used when importing the BPOE module locally.
- The self‑evolve reusable workflow can only be `workflow_dispatch`/`schedule` from **default branch** in the consumer repo. Until merged, test locally with PS7 or keep a temporary job on the feature branch.
