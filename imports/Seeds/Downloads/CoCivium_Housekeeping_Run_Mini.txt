# CoCivium: Housekeeping Prompt (Mini)

Paste this in a fresh chat to run a quick update if you’re in a rush.

Goal: Get up-to-date on CoCivium / CoCache / GIBindex / Civium and output:
- Sync deltas per repo
- 1-week workqueue (Must/Should/Could)
- Ready-to-paste Git Bash blocks

Inputs I’ll provide now:
- For each repo: either a ZIP of the tree (no .git) OR `git diff --name-status <LAST_SHA>..HEAD`.
- Current main SHAs for each repo.

Constraints:
- Be explicit about missing files; request exact paths.
- Keep initial output ≤ 120 lines; offer drill-down on request.
- Prefer Windows Git Bash–safe commands.

Begin when I paste SHAs and upload ZIPs/diffs.
