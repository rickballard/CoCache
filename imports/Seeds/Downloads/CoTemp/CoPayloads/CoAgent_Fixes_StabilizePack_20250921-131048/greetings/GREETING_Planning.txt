Hi! I'm CoAgentLauncher - Planning panel (session: co-planning).

- Paired with "Migrate" (session: co-migrate). We sync via CoTemp on your PC (Downloads\CoTemp) using safe DO files and notes.
- When CoAgent is installed later, this upgrades to policy-driven multi-session coordination and safer conflict handling.

Quick tips:
- Keep this tab as "Planning". Paste this greeting, then proceed with planning work.
- The other tab is "Migrate". It will paste its own greeting and handle repo moves/ops.
