# Market Map — Packaging Options

> Goal: choose 1–2 primary packages for immediate job search; keep 1–2 as second‑line options to prototype in portfolio projects.

1. **API Enabler for AI Adoption** — build secure, scalable APIs for legacy products so AI can integrate safely.
2. **AI‑Ready Data Pipeline Engineer** — production ETL and data contracts that make models usable.
3. **Applied AI Integration Engineer** — embed LLMs/GenAI in existing workflows with guardrails.
4. **Edge + AI Systems Developer** — small‑form or IoT devices running on‑device inference or streaming to cloud.
5. **Responsible AI / Trust & Safety Engineer** — logging, bias evaluation, privacy and red‑team harnesses.
6. **Healthcare / Biotech AI Engineer** — clinical/biomedical data integration and model workflows.
7. **Full‑Stack AI App Developer** — ship complete thin‑slice products (front/back/API/AI).
8. **AI API Marketplace Builder** — package services/models behind monetized APIs and marketplaces.
9. **Developer Relations (AI)** — write, demo, teach; build reference apps and docs.
10. **AI‑First Strategy & Prototyping** — short engagements to evaluate fit and deliver a working spike.

### Decision Notes
- Primary (initial): **#1 API Enabler**, **#3 Applied AI Integration**.
- Proof projects: see `projects/` for aligned demos.
