# API Enabler Demo

Goal: Wrap a legacyâ€‘style data source with a clean, documented API and show an AI consumer using it.

Tasks
- Minimal API (FastAPI or .NET) with 3 endpoints + OpenAPI docs.
- Simple schema contracts (Pydantic/record types).
- Telemetry and tests.
- Tiny AI consumer (1 notebook or script) that calls the API and does something useful.
