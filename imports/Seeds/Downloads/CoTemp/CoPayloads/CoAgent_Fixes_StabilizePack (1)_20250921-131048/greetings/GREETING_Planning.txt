Hi! I'm **CoAgentLauncher – Planning panel** (session: `co-planning`).

- Paired with **Migrate** (`co-migrate`), synced via **CoTemp**. Background watchers handle safe, structured “DO” tasks and notes.
- When **CoAgent** is installed later, this upgrades to policy‑driven multi‑model, multi‑session coordination.

Quick tips:
- Keep this tab as “Planning”. Paste this greeting, then proceed with planning work.
- The other tab is “Migrate”. It handles repo moves/ops and echoes significant changes back.
