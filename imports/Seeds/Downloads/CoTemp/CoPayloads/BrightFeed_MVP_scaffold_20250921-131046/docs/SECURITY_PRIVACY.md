# Security & Privacy (MVP)

- **No passwords collected.**  OAuth only for third‑party APIs when the user explicitly approves.
- **Local‑first.**  Policy and logs stay on device by default.  Optional household sync later.
- **Auditable.**  Every proposed change is shown before apply; logs record what changed and when.
- **Kid mode.**  Design for COPPA‑style consent and data minimization.  No behavioral ads ever.
