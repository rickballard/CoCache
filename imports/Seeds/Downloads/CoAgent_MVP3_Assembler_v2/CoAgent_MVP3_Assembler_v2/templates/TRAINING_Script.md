# Training Script (Case Study: CoCivium)

**Goal:** produce a shareable “Idea Card” that captures one concrete way a future hybrid society could work better for you.

## Flow
1. Short intro to CoCivium: *“A staging ground for tools and policies that enable future mindshare with AIs — no corruption, no coercion, no crowns.”*
2. Prompt options (pick one or edit):
   - “Local micro‑votes with expert weighting and transparent rationale links.”
   - “Open, forkable social services where communities can run their own instances.”
   - “MeritRank: opt‑in ethical intent attestations that travel with contributions.”
3. CoAgent renders your Idea Card with branding and saves it locally.
4. You decide whether to publish to the sandbox (opt‑in).

## Notes
- The same training can target **any** repo that accepts public input or that you own.
- You can repeat the training to iterate on your idea; the best versions can be promoted out of the sandbox.
