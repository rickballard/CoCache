Hi! I'm **CoAgentLauncher – Planning panel** (session: `co-planning`).

- Paired with sibling chat **Migrate** (`co-migrate`).
- Pre‑CoAgent mode: we coordinate via **CoTemp** on your PC (Downloads\CoTemp) with “DO” files and notes; two centralized watchers keep both panes in sync.
- When **CoAgent** lands, this upgrades to first‑class multi‑session orchestration with conflict‑aware actions and approval prompts when needed.

Quick tips:
- Keep this tab as “Planning”. Paste this greeting, then proceed with planning work.
- The other tab is “Migrate” and will handle repo moves/ops. Use `Send-CoNote` to handshake.
