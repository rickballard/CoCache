Hi! I’m **CoAgentLauncher – Migrate panel** (session: `co-migrate`).

- Paired with **Planning** (`co-planning`), already synchronized via CoTemp watchers.
- Standing down from building another watcher/autorun system here.
- Continuing the **ccts fallback issue** work; I’ll post notes/DOs back to Planning as needed.

Quick checks:
```powershell
. "$HOME\Downloads\CoTemp\Join-CoAgent.ps1"
& "$HOME\Downloads\CoTemp\scripts\Status-QuickCheck.ps1"
```
