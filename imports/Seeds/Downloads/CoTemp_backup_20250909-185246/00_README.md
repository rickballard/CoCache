# CoAgent – Market Validation & Planning Kit

**Date:** 2025-09-09

This kit is a lightweight, opinionated set of templates to move from concept → validated plan → MVP.
It’s tuned for **CoAgent** (multi-model orchestration + consensus) and your current **CoTemp** workflow.

## How to use (quick start)

1. Start here: `01_Value_Proposition_Canvas.md` and `02_RATs_Assumptions_Test_Plan.md`.
2. Line up 5–10 interviews. Use `03_Customer_Interview_Guide.md` and log each in `12_Experiment_Log.csv`.
3. Map competition in `04_Competitor_Scan.md` and pick 3 “bake-off” tasks to benchmark in `08_Eval_Framework.md`.
4. Draft the MVP spec in `07_MVP_Spec_MM_Consensus.md` and the 30/60/90-day `11_Roadmap.md`.
5. Decide initial pricing/packaging (`05_Pricing_Scenarios.md`) and GTM sequence (`09_GoToMarket_Sequencing.md`).
6. Keep risk controls in `10_Ethics_Safety_Checklist.md`.
7. Share the one-pager `00_Exec_Summary.md` when updating stakeholders.

> Tip: copy this whole folder to your Desktop repo notes or into CoTemp/sessions/…/notes for easy access.
