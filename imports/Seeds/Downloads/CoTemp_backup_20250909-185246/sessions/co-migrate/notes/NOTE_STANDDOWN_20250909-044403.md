# Migrate: Stand Down (watcher duplication)
You’re paired with **co-planning**. A centralized watcher is already running.
Please **do not** start another inbox watcher here.

Continue:
- **ccts fallback** remediation (priority)
- Migration-specific repo moves/ops

To send Planning a task: drop a DO into:
$home\Downloads\CoTemp\sessions\co-planning\inbox

— Runtime will route and log automatically.
