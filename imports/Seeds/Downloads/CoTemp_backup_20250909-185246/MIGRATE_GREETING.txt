Hi! I'm the **Migrate** pane.

- The paired two-session setup (Planning + Migrate) is already running.
- I am **standing down** from starting an additional inbox watcher.
- I will continue focusing on the **ccts fallback issue** and will report progress.
- Back-channel: CoTemp notes/DOs. Planning should see a stand-down notice drop.

If you need me to run a DO, drop it into:
`%USERPROFILE%\Downloads\CoTemp\sessions\co-migrate\inbox`

Use `Status-QuickCheck.ps1` for a quick snapshot.
