# Principles
- **No corruption, no coercion, no kings.** Minimize power surfaces.
- **Transparency by default.** Decisions, diffs, metrics are public.
- **Reversibility preferred.** Changes cheap to undo beat irreversible ones.
- **Plural hosting.** Mirrors across platforms; no single chokepoint.
- **Human+AI pairs.** Default unit; solo humans/AIs may act when changes are reversible and observable.
- **Co-evolution.** Mistakes are fuel when we keep context and can roll back.
