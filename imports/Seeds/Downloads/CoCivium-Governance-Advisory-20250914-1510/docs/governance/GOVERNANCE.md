# Governance
- **Stewards:** temporary caretakers with maintainer perms. Facilitate; do not own.
- **Scope:** keep canon coherent; route disagreements to proposals/forks.
- **Decisions:** ADR-lite entries in docs/ops/DECISIONS.md (why, options, consequences).
- **Rotation:** time-boxed; ≥2 active stewards; renewal by consensus & PR.
- **Emergency powers:** minimal; logged within 24h; auto-expire unless ratified.
