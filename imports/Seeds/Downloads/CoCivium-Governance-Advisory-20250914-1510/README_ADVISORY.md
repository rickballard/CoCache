# CoCivium Governance Advisory (drag/drop plan)

**Scope:** ownerless-by-design, steward-led, mirror-ready.  
**Apply in the Grand Migration Finale** (not here). Suggested steps:
1. Create these folders in the target repo (or new org):  
   - docs/governance, docs/ops, .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE, people/stewards
2. Copy the files from this ZIP into those folders.
3. Open a PR titled: "governance: stewarded-not-owned bootstrap".
4. Review/merge in committee; log the decision in docs/ops/DECISIONS.md.
5. Configure mirrors per docs/governance/MIRRORS.md.

Why: resist capture (any human/AI/platform), prefer reversible changes, keep transparent logs, rotate stewards.
