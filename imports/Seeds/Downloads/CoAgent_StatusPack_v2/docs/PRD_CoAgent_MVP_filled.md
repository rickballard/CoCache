# CoAgent — MVP PRD (public draft)
- Problem: concurrent repo ops collide; duplicate watchers; weak provenance.
- MVP: local CoTemp runtime, one watcher/session, DO/Note bridge, launcher, status tool.
- Non-goals: cloud orchestration, secrets brokering, transactional multi-repo merges.
- Metrics: time-to-first-DO < 5 min; header pass > 95%.
