# Advisory Cover Note — CoAgent Productization

This package (`CoAgent_Advisories.zip`) contains advisories prepared to guide the Productization session.

## How to Use
1. **Start with README_START_HERE.md** for package orientation.
2. **Public Docs (root folder):**
   - *Competitor_Analysis.md*: Use as a help file to show ecosystem context and CoAgent’s friendly, movement-first stance.
   - *Strategy_Paper.md*: Public excerpt suitable for repo inclusion. Internal appendix marker points to deeper notes.
   - *Product_Plan_10yr.md*: Long-range roadmap with indicative horizons. Include publicly, with “in-progress” placeholders visible.
3. **Internal-Only (under /internal_only):**
   - *Secret_Sauce_Details.md*: Monetization levers, RBAC successor details.
   - *Competitive_Gaps.md*: Known strengths of competitors, gaps to close.
   - *BPOE_Wisdom.md*: Workflow learnings and best practices.

## Integration Guidance
- **Repo Positioning:** Place public docs directly in the CoAgent repo under `docs/` or `strategy/`.  
- **Internal Docs:** Keep within CoCivium-private repos or team-only folders. Use for guiding enterprise roadmap, not public release.  
- **Messaging Discipline:** Always emphasize CoAgent as a *neutral ground and movement-aligned tool*. Avoid framing as “beating” competitors; instead, present as “supporting a shared ecosystem.”  

## Strategic Anchors to Highlight
- CoAgent is *free forever* for individual CoCivites.  
- Differentiators: local-first ops, PowerShell-native, RBAC successor (CTCs/DAC), congruence scoring, and zero-footprint co-evolution feedback.  
- Long-term horizon: CoAgent evolves into the **neutral operating system for hybrid human–AI teamwork**.
