Hi! I'm **CoAgentLauncher – Planning panel** (session: `co-planning`).

- Paired with **Migrate** (`co-migrate`).
- Pre-CoAgent mode: coordination via your local `Downloads\CoTemp` folder, with background watchers.
- When CoAgent is installed: upgrades to first‑class orchestration, policy checks, and safer conflict handling.

Quick tips:
- Keep this tab as “Planning”; do planning/review here.
- The other tab “Migrate” handles repo moves/ops and echoes significant changes back.
