# CoCivium Alignment Guide for Grant-Linked Access

## Purpose

This document defines what it means for a grant-giving institution, foundation, or partner to be "aligned with CoCivium" for the purposes of receiving privileged access to CoCivium tools, services, or support. It ensures consistent, transparent expectations for all parties and prevents misuse or misinterpretation of CoCivium’s offer.

## Why Alignment is Relevant

CoCivium is a consent-first civic infrastructure project. It offers its tools freely, but selectively partners with institutions that respect and reinforce its ethos. Grants or benefits tied to CoCivium products require recipients to uphold minimal values of transparency, non-coercion, and collective benefit. This is not about control—it is about trust and mutual reinforcement.

## What Alignment *Does Not* Mean

- You are **not** required to adopt CoCivium’s governance structure.
- You are **not** bound to open source your own tools.
- You are **not** financially liable or expected to donate.

## What Alignment *Does* Entail (Initial Summary)

- Publicly stated commitment to non-coercive, public-interest use of funds or tools.
- Openness to interoperating with CoCivium APIs or records systems.
- Willingness to publish impact or usage reports (if using CoCivium tools at scale).
- Acknowledgment of CoCivium on your grant or award materials if CoCivium is involved.

Further details will be negotiated per grant, but these defaults provide a stable, predictable baseline.
